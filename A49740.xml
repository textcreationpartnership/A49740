            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>CHirurgery</hi> or <hi>Surgery</hi> (as we ſhall write it in
compliance with the preſent uſage) is an Art which inſtructs us how to
cure a Multitude of Diſeaſes incident to the Bodies of Men, by the help of
Manual Operation. This is one of the three principal Members of the Art of
Phyſick, without which it would be lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; and however Cuſtom
has made it a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Art, and a ſort of Inferiour Employment; yet it is
evident it does not require leſs Study, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and Knowledge, than the
other Parts of Medicine, and in many Reſpects, for the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and
Expedition of the cure, deſerves to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them. Many
Diſtempers indeed are conquered by a Regular Diet, and the aſſiduous
Uſe of proper internal Remedies; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there are others which
are invincible by any milder way, and require the uſe of Inſtruments and
external Applications, which alone are capable of giving certain and effectual
Relief to the languiſhing Patient.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:42110:3"/>
            <p>The Invention of Surgery is aſcribed to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculapius,</hi>
whoſe two Sons <hi>Podalirius</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaon,</hi> are celebrated by
<hi>Homer</hi> for their rare Skill and Dexterity, and the great Services they
did in curing the wounded Men in that famous Expedition againſt <hi>Troy.
Chiron</hi> and his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil <hi>Achilles</hi> are extolled for their
extraordinary Knowledge of Simples, inſomuch that Ulcers which require the
Skill of a finiſht Surgeon to cure them, are ſtill called
<hi>Chironia,</hi> and that Plant with which <hi>Achilles</hi> is reported to
have cured <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephus</hi> after he had wounded and defeated him, ſtill
bears the Name of <hi>Sideritis Achillaea.</hi> But the firſt who has
committed any thing of this kind to writing, was the Great <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth in Deſcent from <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> whoſe
Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical Pieces <hi>of Fractures, Of the Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Of reducing Bones
by Machines, Of Wounds in the Head,</hi> &amp;c. are not eſteemed by the
learned World, inferiour to any of his Writings in the other Parts of Medicine.
After this great Man ſeveral of his Country men made Improvements, and this
Art for a Series of many Ages, ſeemed as it were confined to the Natives of
<hi>Greece.</hi> The next who applied themſelves to improve the
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Operations of Surgery, were the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:42110:3"/>of which the Writings of <hi>Albucaſis,</hi> and ſome portions
of <hi>Avicenn</hi> are the only Remains. In the laſt place, about two or
three Centuries, or ſince it was introduced into <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Guido
de Cauliaco, Joannes de Vigo,</hi> &amp;c. who ought juſtly to be accounted
the Fathers of the Modern Surgery; but as yet it was rude and imperfect till
<hi>Ambroſe Parry, Fab. Hildanus, Fab. ab Aquapendente,</hi> &amp;c. by their
ſucceſsful Labours advanced it to a higher pitch than their
Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; however it was impoſſible but it muſt be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for want of the later Diſcoveries in Anatomy, and ſince that Science has
been cultivated, and the Structure of Humane Bodies in many particulars better
known, Surgery has neceſſarily received great Advantages. Since this new
Light has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced (which has made the productions of a few Years
exceed thoſe of many preceding Ages) no Nation has been more Induſtrious to
bring Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery to perfection than the <hi>French;</hi> and this is owing
almoſt entirely to the Maſter Surgeons of the School of St.
<hi>Coſmus,</hi> who have applied themſelves with the laſt Diligence, to
inſtruct eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Member of their Body in all parts of an Art which is of ſo
great Uſe and Importance to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:42110:4"/>
            <p>But our preſent Deſign is not to ſet forth the Nature or
Excellence of this Art, or give a Hiſtory of the Degrees by which it has been
perfected; and therefore we ſhall content our ſelves with giving the Reader
an Account of the Volume we here preſent him with, and informing him what he
may expect to find in it. Antiquity has produced many excellent Pieces; but the
great Diſcoveries in the Humane Microcoſm, have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a large Field for
Improvements, and the New Philoſophy has furniſhed us with more
ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Accounts, than the Obſcure and Uncertain Principles of the
Ancients could poſſibly aſſiſt us to find out. This is ſo evident
and clear, that it is a ſurprizing Thing, that Surgery ſhould not be
ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier advanced by it, and all along till very lately, the old beaten Path
trodden without any regard to the Modern Inventions. Our Author has reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this in a great Meaſure in the following Work, in which he has preſented
the Reader with ſuch Inſtructions for performing the Operations, and ſuch
Reaſons for the Accidents which attend them, as are agreeable to the
Structure of the Parts, and the New Doctrines in Philoſophy. The whole Volume
is an entire Syſtem, which contains all the Operations in the Practice of
Surgery, and the <pb facs="tcp:42110:4"/>Different manners of Performing them now in Uſe,
and they are all delivered in a moſt exact order. For Inſtance, in the
firſt place he premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Definition, for the giving his Reader a
Succinct Account of the Subject under his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; Then he explicates
the Nature and Cauſe of the Diſeaſe which he grounds on the Structure of
the Part, and this enables the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt to give a Rational and Satisfactory
Account of what he propoſes to perform, by this means to diſtinguiſh
himſelf from Empirick or Ignorant Mechanick, who can give no other Reaſon,
than the Practice of his Maſter. In the next place he delivers the Signs, as
well thoſe which ſerve to detect the Nature of the Diſeaſe, as thoſe
which aſſiſt the Surgeon to make a Juſt Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick of the Event.
After theſe neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, he proceeds to the Operation it
ſelf, in which he gives Inſtructions extending even to the moſt minute
Circumſtances which can happen, to this he ſubjoyns the Dreſſings,
ſeveral ſorts of Bandages, and ſo proceeds through the whole Method of
treating the Patient, preſcribings in every Caſe a proper Regimen, and
Medicaments to Compleat and perfect the Cure. In the laſt place, which is not
the leaſt curious of the whole, he adds <pb facs="tcp:42110:5"/>a great Number of
extraordinary and inſtructive Obſervations, extracted out of the Writings
of <hi>Kerkringius, Bartholine,</hi> the <hi>German Tranſactions,</hi> and
other Authors, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Fabricius Hildanus,</hi> whoſe Merit
is acknowledged by all knowing Judges. In ſhort; to avoid any farther
expatiating on particulars, whoever ſhall peruſe this Piece with Care from
beginning to end, will find an ample Collection of uſeful and ſolid
Knowledge. But I ſhall not undertake to preingage the Readers Favour, but
rather chuſe to abandon this Work to his impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Cenſure, and leave him
to the Liberty to embrace what he finds in it agreeable to Reaſon and
Experience, and to Reject the Reſt.</p>

                  <hi>Syntheſis</hi> is <hi>the dexterous reuniting parts

               <p>
                  <hi>Diaereſis</hi> is <hi>dividing with judgment parts which

               <p>
                  <hi>Exaereſis</hi> is <hi>the Artful extracting extraneous

               <p>The <hi>CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> of Operations are Diſeaſes incurable,
except by an induſtrious Application of the Hand. Thus Parts mortified, Bones

Brain <hi>the Trepan,</hi> the Strangulation of the Gut in the
<hi>Scrotum,</hi> the <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> with an infinity of the like nature
amply treated of in this Courſe of Operations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>SIGNS</hi> which inſtruct the Surgeon in what caſes
an Operation is neceſſary, are taken from the various Diſeaſes to which
Humane Bodies are ſubject, and ſhall be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered in treating
of each particular.</p>
               <p>In each <hi>OPERATION</hi> it is neceſſary to know what is
to be done <hi>Before, At the time of performing it,</hi> and <hi>After it is
over. Before the Operation,</hi> all neceſſaries muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for
the well performing it. <hi>During the making it,</hi> all the Rules
preſcribed muſt be carefully obſerved, and <hi>After it,</hi> Care muſt
be had for the Perfecting the Cure.</p>
               <p>Farther there are four Things to be regarded, <hi>Of what Nature
the Operation is, For what Reaſon it is attempted, If Neceſſary</hi> and
<hi>Poſſible,</hi> and <hi>The Manner of performing it. The Firſt</hi>
may be learnt in the Definition. <hi>The Second</hi> from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the
Nature of the Diſeaſe incurable by other means. <hi>The Third</hi> muſt
be determined by comparing the Diſeaſe, the Strength and Conſtitution of
the Patient, and the Part affected. <hi>The Laſt</hi> is fully delivered in
the Rules of Art, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in their proper places.</p>
               <p>If the Operation can be deferred, it is beſt to wait for the
moſt favourable Seaſon, <hi>Spring, Autumn, Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer</hi>
having all different Advantages conducing to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Cure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spring</hi> puts new life into the Blood and Spirits
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center'd by the Winters Cold, raiſes a kind Fermentation, and exalts them
to the Surface of the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Autumn</hi> ſweetens and calms the Blood, grown
ſharp and ſour by the loſs of its Spirituous and Balſamick parts,
diſſipated by the immoderate Heats of the Summer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Winter</hi> cloſes the Pores, obſtructs
Tranſpiration, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the Circulation, which has ſcarce vigour enough to

               <p>THE REMARKS annexed to each Operation, we hope will be uſefull
to thoſe who peruſe them; They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the Beſt and moſt

Month, received a Gun-ſhot wound on the Right Thigh, not with any Bullet, but
a Pellet of chew'd Paper only, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Muſcles a Fingers length.
The Child in the Womb was ſo much affected with the Blow, that it dyed
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; ſome time after the waters in which the <hi>Foetus</hi>
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſwims, made their way. The Succeeding Day the Woman was delivered
of a Child, Dead, Black, Flab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and Stinking: After ſome Time ſhe began to
recover, and the Wound was compleatly healed in 24 Days.</p>

               <p>THE DIAGNOSTICK SIGNS. In <hi>External Wounds</hi> the
Diviſion of the Fleſh is viſible, but <hi>Internal</hi> are not ſo
eaſily diſcovered.</p>
               <p>If a Wound penetrate the Breaſt, and the Patient bring up
Blood in Coughing, you can hear the Air come out of the Wound in expiration, it
is a ſign <hi>the Lungs</hi> are wounded, and the Veſſels hurt.</p>
               <p>If there be a plentiful effuſion of blood from the Breaſt,
and the puſh is directed towards <hi>the Heart,</hi> there is ground to fear
that important Organ is hurt.</p>
               <p>If the Blood which comes from it be Hot, Black and Boiling, it
is probable <hi>the Right Ventricle</hi> is hurt, but if it be of a Florid
Scarlet colour and Frothy, it is <hi>the Left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle</hi> which has
received the Thruſt.</p>
               <p>When the Heart is wounded, the Arteries beat feebly; The Face
turns Pale, the Extream parts grow chill, and the whole Body is covered with a
cold Sweat.</p>
               <p>If <hi>the Diaphragm</hi> be wounded, the Patient can ſcarce
breath, feels a great pain in the Back, Shoulders and Arms.</p>
               <p>If <hi>the Spinal Marrow</hi> be hurt, the Nerves are relaxed,
all Senſe loſt, ſometimes the Seed and Urine come away involuntarily.</p>
               <p>If <hi>the Aſpera Arteria</hi> be hurt, the Patient ſpits
Blood, has a great pain towards his Back, the Voice becomes Hoarſe, and the
Tongue Dry.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42110:17"/>
               <p>If <hi>the Guts are</hi> hurt and the <hi>wound be ſmall,</hi>
there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Syncopes, Inquietude, Convulſions and Fever. If the Patient
vomit or void blood by Stool, or the Faeces come forth, it is certain the
<hi>wound is large.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the thruſt be in the Belly, and there happen a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
effuſion of Blood, it is a ſign <hi>the Great Artery or Vena Cava</hi> is
cut.</p>
               <p>When <hi>the Stomach</hi> is wounded, the Patient has cutting
Pains, Bilious Vomiting, Cold Sweats, the Hiccough; loſes all Appetite, and
the Aliment comes forth of the wound, if it be very large.</p>
               <p>If the wound be on the right Side a little above the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and
penetrates far in, and ſomething obliquely towards the Baſtard Ribs, and
black Blood come plentifully from the wound, the Party wounded feels great pain
in theſe parts, vomits Bile, and lies on his Belly more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, than
in any other poſture, you may pronounce, <hi>the Liver is wounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the wound be on the left Side deep, and near the Seat of the
Spleen, and a black Blood iſſue from it, it is a ſign <hi>the Spleen is
hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In wounds of the Kidneys, the Patient piſſes with great
Difficulty; The Urine is Bloody, and a pain is felt in the Groin.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Sphincter of the Bladder</hi> is hurt, the Urine
flows out involuntarily, and if <hi>its Bottom</hi> it comes out in the Belly,
and through the Orifice.</p>
               <p>There is reaſon to fear, <hi>the Brain and its Meninges</hi>
are Hurt, when the Fracture of the Skull is of a large extent, the Eyes are
Swoln and full of pain, the Face is red and inflamed, the Patient is
<hi>Comatoſe,</hi> a Fever is kindled, with a hard Pulſe, ſhaking Fits
frequently recurring, and Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: He voids Blood by the Noſe, Mouth or
Ears. The Excrements and Urine come away involuntarily, and a a Syncope,
Vomitings, Convulſion, Delirium, Lethargy and Apoplexy. The Lungs and the
Liver Apoſtemate, which is diſcovered by a fixed Pain on the ſides of the
Breaſt, or the Region of the Liver, or by frequent Rigours. All or ſeveral
of theſe ſigns concurring, are ſufficient to ſhew the Brain is

                     <hi>The Inſtruments</hi> here to be uſed, are the
<hi>Fingers, Needles</hi> and <hi>Thread.</hi> You muſt have <hi>Needles</hi>
of different Figures and Sizes, Streight, Crooked, Flat, all ſharp and of
well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Metal. The Thread muſt be ſingle or double, as the Nature of
the wound ſhall require.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Interrupted Suture.</head>
                     <p>To make this Suture, you muſt begin to clear the Wound
from all extraneous Bodies and Coagulated Blood. A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt hold
together the Lips. Theſe Cautions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Sutures. You muſt
paſs the Needle with the Waxed Thread in it, into the middle of the wound
from without inwards, leaving a moderate Diſtance between each Stitch. You
muſt pierce deep enough, and go to the Bottom of the wound, leaſt an
effuſion of Blood there obſtruct the Reunion.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>a Wound have Angles,</hi> you muſt begin the Suture
there. Before you tye the Knot, you muſt bring the Edges of the wound
together, which if they are not Level, will leave an inequality in Cicatrizing.
If <hi>Wounds have no Angles,</hi> you muſt begin to tye that Thread which is
in the midſt, and <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42110:19"/>make a ſimple knot on the ſide
oppoſite to the diſcharging of the Matter; on this knot you muſt lay a
ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of Linen Cloth Waxed, on which you muſt make a
ſlip-knot, which may with eaſe be undone if any Accident happen.</p>
                     <p>If you intend to cover the wound after the Suture with an
Emplaſter, you muſt lay a ſmall Compreſs on the knots to hinder its
ſticking to them, which creates a great deal of trouble to the Patient in
taking off the Dreſſings.</p>
                     <p>If any Inflammation happen, you muſt dextrouſly looſe
the knots in ſuch manner, that you may cloſe all again when the Accidents
are abated. But if the Accidents are ſo preſſing as to oblige you to cut
the Threads, you muſt paſs a Cannu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Probe under them, and ſlide the
point of the Sciſſars on the <hi>Cannula.</hi> After the Reunion is
compleated, you muſt cut the Threads on the Probe, obſerving to put your
finger on the knots to ſtay the Fleſh; and draw out the Thread gently, to
prevent tearing open the wound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In Superficial wounds</hi> you muſt uſe ſtreight
Needles, in <hi>Deep</hi> ones crooked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The twiſted</hi> Suture is uſed in the Hare-lip, of

                     <head>The Dry Suture.</head>
                     <p>This is only made in Superficial wounds, in places where we
muſt be careful to avoid Deformity, as in the Face or Hands of the Fair Sex.
This Suture is not very much to be depended on, becauſe moſt commonly it
looſens. The <hi>Manner of making</hi> it is thus. Take two pieces of new
Linen Cloth with their Hemms on, proportioned to the largeneſs of the Wound.
The Hemms muſt be laid on the edges of the wound, then cut the Cloth into
Digitations, at a convenient diſtance from each other. The number of
Digitations muſt be equal to the number of Stitches you intend to make; to
the end of each Digitation, ſow a ſmall Ribbon; then dip the Cloth in
ſtrong glew, and apply it a Fingers breadth from the edges of the wound;
theſe Ribbons muſt be tyed to each other in ſuch manner, that the edges
of the wound may touch.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The Glovers Stitch.</head>
                     <p>This is made in great wounds of the Guts and <hi>Scrotum. To
make it,</hi> Take a ſtraight Needle with waxed Thread: then take the two
Lips of the Wound between the <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42110:19"/>Thumb and Fore-finger,
whilſt an Aſſiſtant holds the Gut at one end: Then ſtitch it
length-ways, paſſing the Thread beneath and over the Lips of the wound, in
the ſame manner Glovers uſe to ſtitch their Leather.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wounds altered by the Air</hi> do not admit of Sutures,
theſe are not to be cured without Suppuration, becauſe the Nitre of the Air
waſting the Unctuous parts of the Blood, which is the Balſam uſed by
Nature for the uniting of Wounds, and keeping the Parts ſupple, the Fibres
grow dry, the Pores are contracted, and dangerous obſtructions enſue.
Beſides the Salts of the Air lodging in wounds, are changed into a Vitriolick
Arſenical Matter, which corrodes and frets the Veſſels, hinders the Cure,
and cauſes a Gangrene.</p>
                     <p>Sutures are not convenient in <hi>contuſed Wounds,</hi>

<hi>in the Bites of Venomous Animals,</hi> as well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their
Contuſion, as the continual irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Venom, which moleſts the
Part, infects the Maſs of Blood, hinders the Reunion. In this caſe the
external Remedies muſt be moſt potent Reſolvents, and the Internal
Cordials and Corroborants. Nor in <hi>Diviſions of the larger
Veſſels,</hi> where the great Flux of Blood and Pledgits with Stypticks
thruſt into the wound; Nor in wounds of the Breaſt, where the perpetual
Motion obſtructs the Union. It is a queſtion among Practitioners, if
Sutures may be made <hi>on Bones laid bare.</hi> I ſhall declare in ſhort
my Opinion. If there be a Contuſion or Fracture in the Bone, an exfoliation
muſt be procured, and ſince there is no better way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this, than to
expoſe the Part to be altered by the Air, you muſt not make any Suture in
this Caſe. But if the Bone be ſound and entire, and you deſire to
preſerve it from Exfoliation, a Suture muſt be made without delay, in which
there is no danger; becauſe the Threads may eaſily be cut, if any Accident
ſhall preſs. In the laſt place Longitudinal Wounds do not require Suture,
the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting Bandage</hi> being ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>THE MANNER OF DRESSING is directed in each Operation, where
Sutures are neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>THE CURE IN SIMPLE WOUNDS, conſiſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting the
divided parts, in removing all external Obſtacles, ſuch as Coagulated

                     <p>Since the Blood is the true Balſam which Nature makes

                     <p>The ill impreſſions of the Air, muſt be corrected by
Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Applications, which muſt be Volatil, Saline and Oleous,
Reſembling the Blood which is the Natural Balſam, ſuch are <hi>Balſam

Account of their Viſcoſity, which makes them hurtful to the Nervous parts,
rotting them, ſtopping the Pores, and hindring Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration as by a
certain latent Acid, able to corrode Iron and Silver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sharp Medicines</hi> muſt not be applyed to wounds,
Experience ſhewing us they keep wounds open too long, waſte the Fleſh and
Blood, and by their Acrimony bring Pain and Fluxion. Only <hi>Temperate
Balſams</hi> are proper to parts Replete with Blood, and <hi>Temperate</hi>
inclining to Acrid and Bitter for the Nervous parts, which laſt require more
deterging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſince they commonly produce more Filth than other
parts. Add to theſe Vulnerary Potions made of Decoction of proper Plants, as
<hi>Great Sanicle</hi> or <hi>Ladies Mantle, Ground-Ivy, Speedwell,</hi> St.
<hi>Johns wort, Chervil, Crabs-eyes boiled in White-wine,</hi> and drunk every
part of which is Vulnerary. We muſt not uſe theſe Balſams if it be
neceſſary to keep the wound <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42110:20"/>open, as in thoſe which
enter the Cavity of the Breſt, for fear of any Matter which may happen to be
lodged there, or any Inflammation or Contuſion; for here if the wound be
cloſed too ſoon, we have no means left to prevent accidents. Suppuratives
muſt be uſed, which are ordinarily made of <hi>Turpentine, the Yelks of
Eggs, with the Addition of a little Honey, Myrrh, Balſam of Peru,</hi> and
<hi>Gum Elemi,</hi> and after a laudable <hi>Pus</hi> obtained, treat the wound
like a ſimple Ulcer with Mundificants, Sarcoticks, and Aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Wounds then are cured by applying Balſamicks, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extraneous Bodies, approaching their Lips, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by Bandage and

                     <p>Tents dipt in ſome good Balſam, muſt be kept in deep
wounds till their bottom be cleanſed, that their Fleſh may grow up to their
ſides, without which it would encreaſe too faſt, the Orifice cloſe, and
the <hi>Pus</hi> and Filth lodge within, from whence Pains, Inflammations,
Return of the <hi>Abſceſs, Fiſtula's,</hi> and deep <hi>Cyſtis's.</hi>
But before any Tent be put in, it is neceſſary to conſider well, if no
Nervous part lie on the ſide of the wound; in this Caſe Tents too long or
big, will inevitably create acute pain, which irritates the Nervous parts,
corrupts their Juice, and cauſes a dryneſs and extenuation of the Part. The
Tent muſt not be very big, except it be in the middle; not filling the wound
that it may have room to ſwell; its point muſt be ſoft for fear of
Hurting the Fleſh, which begins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and grow again. Tents muſt not be
too long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they are apt to generate a <hi>Callus</hi> on
the edges of the wound, which obſtructs Reunion; but muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſht
by degrees, to give the Fleſh liberty to grow.</p>
                     <p>A Serous Humour gleeting from the wound in the time of
Cicatrizing, makes the Fleſh Flabby and Soft, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons excreſcences,
hinders the Unition, and to Skinning Here Deſiccatives muſt be uſed to
abſorb exceſſive <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42110:21"/>Humidity, and moderate Aſtringents
to correct the Laxity of the Fleſh, and give them a firm conſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>There happens at ſome times, an Inequal Roughneſs and
Hardneſs in the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> after the Part is Healed, which proceeds
from the Fibres of the Skin, not exactly meeting thoſe which they are
ſeparated from, and the Pores and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels which before the Diviſion were
ſtraight and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each other, are confounded and diſplaced; and
from hence the Nutritious Juyce being detained and ſtopped in the Part,
produces a <hi>Callus</hi> in the Bones, and a <hi>Cicatrix</hi> in the
fleſhy parts, eſpecially if Reſtringents and Deſiccatives have been
employ'd, which contract the Pores, make the Fibres firm, and harden the
Part.</p>
                     <p>WOUNDS CONTUSED eaſily putrefie, and this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the
Cure; for this Reaſon, if the Contuſion be ſlight, you muſt have
Recourſe to Suppuratives to ſeparate that which is mortified and bruiſed.
But if the Contuſion and Wound be very great, and you have reaſon to fear
Gangrene before you can obtain a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, you muſt make Inciſions
into, and Scarify the Part, to give iſſue to the Blood, and ſuppurate the
reſt with good Digeſtives, adding <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> by way of
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution. From the firſt you muſt apply Topicks on the part, proper to

                     <p>GUN-SHOT WOUNDS are always attended with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion,
Laceration and Superficial Heat; for this Reaſon you muſt ſuppurate the
Contuſion, which commonly begins to appear on the third or fourth Day, during
which time, it is enough to take off the dreſſings once in twenty four
Hours. After Suppuration made, and the Abſceſs formed, and the contuſed
Matter reſolved, you muſt dreſs the wound with Mundiſicants, and clear
it from all extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies. <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> and <hi>Balſam of

                     <p>WOUNDS FROM THE BITE OR STING OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS, require

Onions</hi> is excellent for the Puncture of Spiders. Scarification is not
neceſſary if the wound be not deep, as the Sting of a Waſp, or ſome

               <p>THIS Operation <hi>is a Stitching of the Tendon to reunite its
parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of the Suture of a Tendon, is its diviſion.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS are evident from the apparent Separation, and loſs
of Motion in the part.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When a Tendon is cut aſunder, it ſuffers no Tenſion,
Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Fluxion, the contracted parts only retiring and encreaſing
ſomething in Bulk. But if the Tendon be divided in Part only, you muſt
inſtantly cut it aſunder, without which there will infallibly follow
Vehement and Sharp Pain, Convulſion, <hi>Syncope's,</hi> Vomiting, Fluxes,
Feavers, <hi>Coma's,</hi> and frequently a Gangrene. The Fibres remaining
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wanting the Aſſiſtance of thoſe which are cut, are burſt and
torn by the contraction of the Muſcle, or ſuffer violent Tenſion, and the
Blood ſpilt in the Wound beginning to ferment, its Saline parts, prick and
moleſt them, which determines the Spirits towards the Muſcles in a great
Hurry and Confuſion, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Convulſion. The Spirits flying to
various parts of the Body in this diſorderly manner, the Heart is deprived of
their influx, diſabled in its motion, and hence <hi>Syncope's</hi>
neceſſarily inſue. The Spirits beginning to regain their Natural
Courſe, redouble their Strength, and Dart them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with great
Swiftneſs into the Fibres of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, by the great communication between
the Nerves of the Heart and this part; and this creates violent
<hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi> and <hi>Vomitings.</hi> The Stomach by its contraction very
much compreſſes the Gall-Bladder, and the Biliary and Pancreatick Duct,
forcing them to diſcharge their contents into the Guts, and from hence
<hi>Fluxes</hi> ariſe. Theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors wanting due preparation, corrupt and
communicate an ill Ferment to the Chyle, with which they are mixt in the
Inteſtines, and from hence <hi>Feavers</hi> proceed. The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Blood
riſes to the Brain with great impetuoſity, and the Veſſels by the flow
Circulation through the <hi>Sinus's,</hi> 
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:42110:24"/>not being

                     </gap>gulars, with the ſame Expedition it is brought
thither, and compreſſes the Nerves ariſing from the Baſis of the Brain,
which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to the Organs of Senſe, and this cauſes the
<hi>Coma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Tendons are ſo far contracted within the Fleſh,
that you cannot draw them out with your <hi>Forceps,</hi> mollifie them with
<hi>Oyl of Wax,</hi> or <hi>Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds drawn without Fire;</hi>
becauſe theſe being Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, are for that reaſon proper to Sheath the
Acidity of the Blood, and abate the Pain. If the opportunity of rejoyning the
Tendon while the Wound is recent be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, you muſt open the Cicatrix as
little as may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fleſh preſerves it from the Alteration
which might otherwiſe happen.</p>
                  <p>In making the Operation, cut as little as may be, the
extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Tendons, if they happen to be callous by remaining long
divided. The part muſt be kept a little bended, for the better approaching of
the two ends, which muſt be brought about one ſixth part of an Inch one
over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. It is not ſufficient for their Unition to have the Edges
brought together, becauſe by the Contraction of the Muſcle, they would be
ſoon drawn aſunder; but by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the one extremity a little over the
other, they are reunited by the Nutritious Juyce iſſuing from their two
Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and forming a ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Surgeon muſt take a Streight, Thin, Flat Needle,
Threaded with a double Thread well waxed, with a Knot at the end, into which he
muſt put a ſmall Compreſs. Then He muſt paſs his Needle from without
inwards into the Tendons, laid over each other, and after from within outwards,
then make a ſimple knot on the ſmall Compreſs, and after that a
ſlip-knot.</p>
                  <p>The DRESSING. When the Operation is finiſhed, you muſt
keep the part bended by the Help of Paſt-board and Bandage, for fear leaſt
the ends of the Tendons ſhould be drawn aſunder, which would make their
Reunion after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. You muſt lay on the Wound a ſmall pledgit
dipt in ſome Spirituous Liquor, and a ſmall Compreſs over it, and keep
all on by Rolling the Part.</p>
                  <p>The CURE. When the Wound is Cicatrized, chafe it with
Spirituous and Balſamick Medicines, to make the Tendon ſupple, and by
degrees extend it ſelf, leſt the Part remain ſtiff and contracted. The
Suture muſt be humected with <hi>Oyl well mixed with Spirit of Wine.</hi> The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42110:24"/>following days you muſt uſe a Balſam made with
<hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Tincture of Aloes in Spirit of Wine,</hi> infuſion of the
<hi>Flowers of St.</hi> Johns <hi>Wort.</hi> All Oyly and Greaſy Medicines
corrupt the Tendons, and muſt be forborn. Cataplaſms made of <hi>Wine,</hi>
with <hi>the four meals, the Yelk of an Egg</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> are very
good in the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. During the whole Cure, you ought to
chafe well the Limb with ſome good Liniments, to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the Nerves;
for example, the Neck, if it be the Arm; and the Spine of the Back, if it be

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Hare Lip.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>The Reuniting a Lip cleft, by the help of
the Twiſted Suture.</hi> This Deformity derives its name from the
Reſemblance to the Lips of Hares which are cleft after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. This Defect is either <hi>Natural,</hi> when the
Child comes into the World with it, or is cauſed after from ſome Cut, Fall,
or other like <hi>Accident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there happen to be a conſiderable loſs of Subſtance,
you muſt not adventure on the Operation. The Cure in this caſe would be
worſe than the Diſtemper it ſelf, and the Skin being ſo tenſe and
cloſe to the Gum, it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to Articulate ſeveral Words, or
move the Lips without a great deal of Trouble. When this happens in the lower
Lip, it proves more obſtinate than in the upper, by reaſon of the
conſtant flowing of the Spittle into the Mouth. It is dangerous to undertake
this Operation in young Infants, becauſe their continual Crying, the
ſoftneſs of the part, and the neceſſity of Sucking, would hinder the
Unition; and therefore it muſt be deferred till they arrive at an Age to
ſubmit to the trouble upon Rational Motives. But if you reſolve to do it,
be ſure to keep the Child from Sleeping for ſome time before, that he may
ſleep ſoundly after the Operation is over.</p>
               <p>This is not to be done in Old Bodies, whoſe wounds are
difficult to be cured, nor in Scorbutic or Pocky People, whoſe Blood is Sharp
and Corroſive, which like an <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> eats and hinders all
Unition. The Blood of Women who want their Courſes, is little better than a
ſerous Maſs, without its due Conſiſtence or Unctuoſity, who therefore
are not proper Subjects for this Operation. But it may be ſucceſsfully
undertaken in Sound, Healthy Bodies of a compleat Age to undergoe it.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS are evident of themſelves, the Deformity being
ſufficiently viſible.</p>

                  <head>THE OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To perform this Methodically, firſt free the Lip from the
Gum with a ſharp Knife; that is, cut the ſmall Filament which ties it down;
and here you muſt have great care in diſengaging the Lip not to hurt the
Gums. It is better in this Caſe to touch ſomething on the ſide of the
Lip, becauſe if we ſhould go too far on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Bone of the Jaw
would be bared, and ever after remain ſo. When the Lip is ſeparated,
ſeize it with your <hi>Forceps,</hi> and with your Sciſſars take off the
Calloſity on the ſides, cutting off as little as poſſible. The
Aſſiſtant who ſtands behind and holds the Patients Head, muſt preſs
his Cheeks forward with both Hands, that the Lips of the Wound may be applyed
level to each other, for the leaſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality would be very deform and
diſagreeable to the Sight; after this paſs a Needle with a waxed Thread
thro' the Lips from without inwards, at a very little diſtance from the
edges, leſt if you do it too cloſe, the Thread may cut thro' the Lip with
the leaſt ſtriving, turn the Thread round the Needle, and after ſeveral
Turns, croſs it above and below the needles. Theſe turnings ſtay the Lip,
and keep its ſides Level. You may paſs as many Needles, as you ſhall
think convenient. If the Lip be great, and the cleft extend quite to the
Noſe, you may paſs three, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the points, and putting a
Compreſs under each end to prevent their pricking, and cauſing an
Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When the Operation is over, wipe the Lips with a
Spunge dipt in Wine a little warm'd, and lay on the Wound a Pledgit dipt in
ſome good Balſam, and between the Lips and Gums a Rag dipt in ſome
Deſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Liquor, to hinder the Lip from growing to the Gums, and over all
apply the Roller with four Tails, or the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting Bandage. To make the Bandage,
take a piece of Linen Cloath about an Inch broad, and an Ell and an half in
length, more or leſs according to the largeneſs of the Subject, make a Hole
in the Roller in the midſt, an inch and an half long, Roll it with two Heads
one at each end. You muſt begin to apply it behind the Patients Head, and
bring the ends of the Roller forwards, and paſs one of them thro' the Hole
you made, then apply the cleft on the part affected, and next bring back the
two ends behind the Head over the other pretty cloſe, and faſten them with
Pins at their ends.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42110:26"/>
                  <p>If you rather chuſe to make uſe of the Roller with four
Tails, this is the manner of making it. Take a Roller a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Inch Broad, and
about an Ell long, more or leſs according to the bigneſs of your Subject.
Double this, and cut it lengthways with your Sciſſars, ſo that there may
remain three fingers breadth plain in the midſt. This Roller is thus cut into
four parts, each of which is called a Tail. You muſt begin with applying the
middle, broad, undivided part of the Roller on the Wound, and the two upper
Heads you muſt paſs behind the Patients Head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and faſten them
at their ends, next take two lower, and paſs them to the hinder part of the
Head aſcending, and having made them croſs with the two upper Tails
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them with Pins at their ending.</p>
                  <p>It is a general Rule in the applying theſe divided Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to make the upper Tails paſs downwards, and the lower paſs upwards, and
ſo croſs with the former.</p>

                     </note>The Emplaſter
muſt have a Traverſe and a Branch at each extremity of the Traverſe. The
Traverſe is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed on the Lip, and each Branch be clapt upwards on
the ſide of the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Dreſſings muſt be removed twice or thrice
after the Operation; for which purpoſe a Servant muſt ſtand behind the
Patient and preſs his Cheeks forward, for ſear the Wound ſhould open it
ſelf, while the Surgeon is taking them of. If there be three Needles, he
muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſt about half the Thread of that in the midſt, and one or two
rounds of the other, and then dreſs it as before: Seven or Eight Days after,
the Dreſſing muſt be taken a ſecond time of, and if the Unition be
compleated, the Needles muſt be gently drawn out, leaſt if they ſhould
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main longer, their Holes might be difficult to fill.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of <hi>Gaſtroraphia</hi> or Stitching the
Belly.</head>
               <p>THIS <hi>is a Suture of the lower Belly, to prevent the Guts and
other parts contained in it from falling out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE which obliges us to make this Operation, is a Wound
received in it.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Wounds of the Belly are <hi>Great</hi> or
<hi>Small,</hi> if they are great enough to let the inteſtines fall thro'
them, you muſt make uſe of the interrupted Suture; but if they are ſmall,
you muſt only put in a Tent for diſcharging of the <hi>Pus.</hi> Wounds of
the lower Belly are <hi>with Laeſion of the Internal Parts,</hi> or
<hi>without.</hi> We conclude that the Internal Parts have received Hurt from
the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> with which the Wound was made, which if it had a
ſharp Edge or Point in all Appearance the Parts are Hurt. We may Judge of the
Hurt by the Acute Pain, Inflammation, Fever, or Evacuated <hi>Matter,</hi>
which may be diſtinguiſhed by its Colour, Smell, Conſiſtence from the
<hi>Pus,</hi> proceeding from the Wound.</p>
               <p>You may make a Judgment of the parts Wounded by the Situation,
and the Poſture the Perſon was in at the Time he received it. If the Guts
or <hi>Omentum</hi> come forth, we muſt examine whether they are mortifyed,
or any ways hurt.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If, there happen to be a great Wound in the Guts, make the
Glovers Suture with a Straight flat Needle, and waxed Thread. A Servant muſt
hold the Gut on one ſide, and your ſelf on the other, make the firſt
ſtitch at a very ſmall diſtance beyond the Wound, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it
lengthways holding it between the Fore-finger and Thumb. You muſt not tie the
Thread, but let one end hang out of the Wound. If the <hi>Omentum</hi> be
fallen out, it is almoſt ever mortified, it being very ſpungy, loaded with
Fat, and its Texture lax, abounding with Humours, and an infinity of
Veſſels in it, upon which Account the Air eaſily penetrating its
Subſtance, Coagulates the Blood, and the part being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its Vital
Warmth and Motion, ſoon Mortifies.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42110:27"/>
                  <p>The Mortification of the <hi>Omentum</hi> is ſoon
diſcovered by its livid Colour, and the corrupted part muſt be cut off
before the reſt be replaced in the Belly. To do this paſs a Needle with a
waxed Thread into the ſound part croſs the <hi>Omentum,</hi> taking care
not to prick the Veſſels. The Ligature muſt be indifferent cloſe, and
you muſt take off part of the <hi>Omentum,</hi> cutting it to the quick an
inch and half above the Ligature. One end of the Thread muſt be left to hang
out of the Wound, the better to bring the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> to its edges, and
Cicatrize it with more eaſe, as well as to draw out the Threads after the
Suppuration has rotted them. The Inflation of the Guts, proceeds from the Air
which inſinuates it ſelf, ſhuts the Pores, obſtructs the Circulation,
and by conſequence cauſes an Inflammation. Beſides all this the Gut
ſuffering Strangulation, the Motion of the Blood is interrupted, and flowing
in by the Arteries, and not returning by the Veins, muſt needs Tumefie the
part. You muſt attempt to diſſipate this, by applying <hi>live
Animals</hi> cut open to them, or by Fomenting with a <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of
Line-ſeed.</hi> The following Medicine is good. ℞. <hi>Flowers of
Chamomil, Melilot</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, one Handfull; <hi>Aniſeed, Sweet Fennel-ſeed,
Cummin-ſeed,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ℥i. <hi>Cloves and Nutmegs</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ℥ſs.
<hi>Boyl all in Milk. To this add Decoction of Spirit of Wine
camphora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> ℥i. <hi>Sugar of Lead,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Oyl of
Aniſeeds,</hi> ℈ij. <hi>and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this Decoction hot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this Suture be made, the Guts muſt be fomented
<hi>with Spirit of Wine, with a little</hi> Camphire <hi>diſſolved in
it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Guts are mortified or gangrened, uſe no unguent, but
foment them with Spirituous and penetrating Liquors. In this caſe, <hi>Oyl of
Flints with a little Spirit of Wine comphora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> is an approved Medicine.
If all theſe <hi>Mediums</hi> happen to be uſeleſs for the Reduction of
the Gut, dilate the Wound; which if it be in the upper part, the Dilatation
muſt be made downwards, if Tranſverſe and near the <hi>Linea alba,</hi>
recede from thence. To make this Dilatation, you muſt bring the Inteſtines
dexterouſly on the ſide of the Wound to find its direction, then lay on a
Compreſs dipt in Wine a little warmed, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Director into the
Belly, turning it on one ſide and another, to prevent engaging the Gut
between it and the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and to be ſure that it is not
engaged, draw it a little back. The Director muſt be held in your left Hand,
and you muſt ſlide in an Inciſion-knife to dilate the Wound, and cut the
Teguments equally <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42110:27"/>within and without. You muſt ſearch
for that part of the Gut which is neareſt to the Orifice of the Wound, which
thruſt back into the Cavity of the Belly with your forefinger, not taking it
out till with the forefinger of your other Hand, you have by degrees thruſt
in the remaining part, and wholly reduced the Gut. There is no neceſſity of
ſhaking the Body, as the Ancients did to reſtore the Guts to their place,
Nature taking ſufficient care in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
                  <p>All parts being reduced, make the interrupted Suture, which is
called <hi>Gaſtroraphia,</hi> when it is practiſed on the Belly.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>For performing this, take two crooked Needles thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with
one Thread, put the forefinger of the left Hand into the Belly, to bring the
<hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> Muſcles and Skin all together to the edges of the
Wound; then hold your Needle together with your Wound, and paſs it from
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in outwards, carrying the point over your forefinger, to prevent hurting
the Gut. Take Scope enough, leaſt the continual Motion of the lower Belly
force the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When this is done without drawing your finger out of the
Wound, take hold of the other ſide, and paſs the Needle from within
outwards, with the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution as before. If there be ſeveral
ſtitches to be made, make them in the ſame manner as the firſt, without
taking your finger out of the Belly. The Threads being all paſs'd, a Servant
muſt hold together the edges of the Wound, and you muſt tie them, beginning
with that in the middle, and obſerving all the Directions we have before
given in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Interrupted Suture. Some pretend that a Tent ought
not to be put into the Wound, which is open enough by the continual Motion of
the Belly.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When the Suture is made, Apply on it a Pledgit
dipt in ſome Balſam or Spirituous Liquor, and Embrocate the Region of the
Belly with <hi>Oyl of Roſes, with a little Spirit of Wine,</hi> then lay on
an Emplaſter, over all a Compreſs dipt in <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> or ſome
other Defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and keep all on with the Napkin, Scapular, or other
convenient Bandage.</p>
                  <p>To make this Bandage, take a great Napkin, fold it three or
four times lengthways, and roll it at both ends to apply it more
commodiouſly. This muſt be laid over the part <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42110:28"/>affected,
you muſt bring it behind, and then forwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and then faſten it with
pins. This <hi>Napkin</hi> muſt be ſupported by the <hi>Scapular,</hi> to
make which, Take a piece of Linen Cloath 7 or 8 Inches broad, half or three
quarters of an Ell in length, make a Hole in the midſt to paſs its Head
through, one of its two ends muſt fall before, and the other behind; and both
muſt be faſtned to the Napkin with Pins; it is beſt to fix them to the
Napkin the firſt Turn. You may cut the <hi>Scapular</hi> ſo that it ſhall
have four Tails, and it will ſupport the Napkin better if theſe are
faſtned ſo, that each Tail were croſs the other.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If the Guts or <hi>Omentum</hi> are Hurt, the
Patient muſt lie on his Belly the firſt Days to give them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
gluing of themſelves to the edges of the Wound, nothing conducing more to
their Cure. You muſt place a ſmall, flat, ſoft, Boulſter under his
Belly. This Situation is proper, becauſe the <hi>Viſcera</hi> bearing their
weight on the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum,</hi> this Compreſſion abates their Motion,
beſides we may obſerve the Internal parts never cured, except by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with Neighbouring parts.</p>
                  <p>During the Cure, the Patient muſt obſerve an exact Diet to
abate the periſtaltick Motion of the Guts. You muſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every day the
Parts with Mollifying and Reſolvent Medicines, to prevent Tenſion, which
mightily obſtructs Reunion, for the Lips making an effort to ſeparate
themſelves cauſe great Pain, and often burſt the Stitches. You muſt
take care to give frequent Clyſters, becauſe they Relax the Fibres, and
dilute the contents of the Guts, as well as cool and allay the Motion of the
Blood and Spirits, and prevent Accidents. Bleeding is a great means to prevent
Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſo are all general Medicines ſeaſonably uſed.</p>
                  <p>If the edges of the Wound are Callous, you muſt have
recourſe to Digeſtives which relax the Fibres, remove Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
promote the production of Fleſh, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence advance the Cure.</p>
                  <p>A good Digeſtive may be made with <hi>Turpentine and the
Yelks of Eggs, adding a little Honey of Myrrh,</hi> and <hi>Gum Elemi.</hi>
This Digeſtive is Unctuous and Temperate, equalling in its Vertues the beſt
Vulneraries and Balſamicks, corrects the Acid in Wounds, puts a ſtop to
their Progreſs, and diſpoſes the vicious Ferment, which is the cauſe of
all Corruption, to be expelled. When the callous edges of the Wound are
ſoftned by Digeſtives, and you have obtained a laudable <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42110:28"/>
                     <hi>Pus,</hi> you muſt uſe Mundificants as in ordinary Ulcers,
without Malignity.</p>

                  <head>REMARKS.</head>
                  <p>If the Gut happen to be quite cut aſunder, the two ends
muſt be ſtitched to the edges of the Wound to which they will reunite; and
you muſt Cicatrize the edges, keeping them from uniting together, which may
be eaſily done by great Tents. This Orifice will ſerve in the Nature of an
<hi>Anus,</hi> as we have ſeen in a Soldier who had one of the great Guts
cut, which was joyned by a <hi>Cicatrix</hi> to the Wound of the Belly, through
which the Faeces paſt, the <hi>Anus</hi> being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up. The moſt

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>General Dropſies</hi> are the <hi>Aſcites, Anaſarca,
Leucophleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſcites</hi> is <hi>Genuine</hi> or <hi>Spurious.</hi>
The <hi>Genuine</hi> ariſes from a quantity of Water which fills the Cavity
of the Belly, and diſtends it to an extraordinary Magnitude. In the
<hi>Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> or <hi>Baſtard Aſcitès,</hi> the Waters are
contained in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Belly, and not in its cavity, and theſe
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are affected. Tho' the Waters float on the Muſcles, yet in opening the
Bodies of Hydropical Perſons, we find the Fibres of the Muſcles whitiſh,
as well as the Neighbouring parts, by their long ſoaking in the Water; but in
all other reſpects, as <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42110:29"/>ſound, ſolid and firm, as if
there had been no ſuch Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and becauſe the Waters which form this
<hi>Anaſarca</hi> are ſweet, inſipid, and void of all Acrimony, and by
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence incapable of infecting the Parts in which they are lodged, the
Patient has no Feaver or Thirſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Urine is ſweet and crude. But
in the <hi>Genuine</hi> Aſcites the Urine is Red, Lixivious, with a violent
Thirſt, and a conſtant He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Feaver, and very ſmall in quantity.</p>
               <p>There are two principal Cauſes which concur in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a
Dropſie, the Diſſolution of the Blood, and the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its
Circulation. The Blood becomes ſerous and incapable of preſerving the Union
of its parts, when the Balſamick parts are diſſipated by violent
Exerciſes, long Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, Exceſſive Grief by the Abundance or
Exaltation of its Salts, and by this Colliquation, it finds ways to get out of
its Veſſels, and produce Dropſies. When the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood is
ſlow, from whatever cauſe it proceeds the Seroſities begin to ſeparate,
as in Milk from the Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part, or in the ſame manner as in the
Porringer after bleeding; becauſe the Motion which it had in the Veſſels
ceaſing, the parts fall together and preſs out the <hi>Serum,</hi> not
unlike Water expreſt out of a Spunge by clinching the Hand. And theſe
Seroſities not being longer detain'd by the Oleous part of the Blood, find a
way to tranſpire thro' the intervals of the Fibres. This Opinion is confirmed
by the experiment of making a Ligature on the Veins, which obſtructing the
Reflux of the Blood, the part becomes Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropick.</p>
               <p>We ſee Women for the moſt part have their Legs Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefied,
during the time of their going with Child, becauſe the <hi>Foetus</hi>
compreſſing the Veſſels which return the Blood to the Heart, the
Circulation is very much impeded. Add to this, that all People dwelling in
Marſhy places, and thoſe who are of a cold Conſtitution, are oftner
attacked with theſe Diſtempers, becauſe the Motion of their Blood is
ſlower.</p>
               <p>When the Waters are included in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> the
Dropſie is for the moſt part incurable. This <hi>Cyſt is</hi> is a Caſe
which by degrees is ſeparated from ſome Neighbouring Membrane, by the
diſcharge of abundance of muddy, ſaline Water, which corrodes thoſe
Filaments by which it was connected to them. It abounds with an infinity of
Glands and Veſſels, which it receives from the Neighbouring parts, all
which afford matter for Dropſies.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42110:29"/>
               <p>The <hi>Anaſarca</hi> or <hi>Leucophlegmatia</hi> is a ſoft
watry Tumour, which extends over the whole Body, eſpecially the Muſcles,
and yields to the impreſſion of the Finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Particular Dropſies</hi> only occupy ſome one part, and
receive different Names from the Parts affected, as <hi>Hydrocephale</hi> in
the Head, <hi>Hydrocele</hi> in the Serotum, and <hi>Hydromphalus</hi> in the
Navil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of a Dropſie are ſwelling of the Belly,
Tranſparence and Fluctation of the Waters, difficulty of Breathing, a Feaver,
a low, quick Pulſe, a Heavineſs of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Inſatiable Thirſt, and
Difficulty of making Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Feaver</hi> ariſes from the impure Chyle and Saline
Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which mixing with the Blood paſs to the Heart, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting there
create a diſorder in its Motion. The Heart by its Communication diſorders
the Pulſe of the Arteries, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles a Feaver which is not very perceptible,
by reaſon of a Deficiency of the Spirits, unable to give the Blood any great
Degree of Motion, and hence comes the <hi>lowneſs of the Pulſe.</hi> The
<hi>Pale Complexion</hi> and <hi>the Heavineſs of the Body,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the ſlow Motion of the Blood, the Maſs of Water with which it is
loaded, and the Diſſipation of the Spirits which are in a manner drowned in
ſuch a quantity. The <hi>Difficulty of Breathing</hi> ariſes from the great
Tenſion of the lower Belly, which preſſes the Diaphragm towards the
Lungs, ſo that wanting liberty to extend it ſelf, Reſpiration becomes
frequent and forced. The <hi>Exceſſive Thirſt</hi> proceeds from the Salt
Waters, which are the Cauſes of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Patient has a
<hi>difficulty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> becauſe the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine which in a Natural State
paſſes through the Kidneys, diſcharges it ſelf into the capacity of the
Belly. Beſides that the Salts of theſe Waters moleſting the Urinary Ducts
and <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Bladder, force them to a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
contraction.</p>

Advice.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Remedies are ineffectual, you muſt proceed to
Operation, which muſt be performed in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Patient
muſt be kept ſitting on his Bed or on a Pillow, to give the Waters leave to
fall down. And a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt hold his Belly with both his Hands, to harden
and ſtay the place in which you deſign to make the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Inſtrument was firſt Deſcribed by <hi>Barhette</hi> in
his Chirurgery, which he ſays was then lately brought out of <hi>Italy</hi>
by Mr. <hi>James Block</hi> a Surgeon at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> This he
publiſhed in his Book, but with this difference, that he makes his of Steel
edged at the point like a Lancet, whereas the other was made of Silver with a
round Point.</note> You muſt pierce the Belly with the Tap or Pipe with a
Needle in it, three or four fingers breadth below the Navel, and about the
ſame diſtance on the ſide, to avoid hurting the <hi>Linea Alba.</hi> You
muſt ſtretch the Skin a little, that it may fill up the Orifice, when you
have drawn your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out. You muſt make the punction at one
thruſt, ſo that your Needle and the <hi>Cannula</hi> which contains it, may
enter the Belly. Then draw the Needle out of the <hi>Cannula,</hi> to give way
for the exit of a ſufficient quantity of Water, which muſt be
proportionable to the Patients ſtrength. This Inſtrument is preferable to
the Lancet; becauſe when you have drawn it out, the Orifice is ſo ſmall
the Waters cannot get out after, and the Aperture made by a Lancet is ſo
great, it is very difficult to ſtop them. If the Waters are thick and muddy,
and cannot paſs through ſo ſmall a puncture, you muſt make the aperture
with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, and leave a <hi>Cannula</hi> in it; till you have drawn out all
the Waters, which you muſt do at ſeveral Times, leaſt <pb n="31" facs="tcp:42110:30"/>you weaken the Patient too much, and throw him into a
<hi>Syncope.</hi> When you make a ſecond puncture with this Inſtrument, it
muſt be below the former. If the Waters make a great ſwelling about the
Navil, make your puncture in this manner deſcribed. But if they fall into the
Legs and Thighs, make Scarifications, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the depth of a Bleeding, four
fingers Breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the internal Ancles, whence you will have a great deal
of Blood and Water; and after lay a little Lint on, and keep it on with a
Bandage. When you would have the Waters come out, you muſt undoe the Bandage
and cauſe the Patient to walk, ſome Body holding him up. If theſe are not
ſufficient, you may Scarifie the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> Prepuce, and Thighs, all
which Rivulets joyning will make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Evacuation.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay on Pledgits and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on the
Scarification, with a Bandage four fingers Broad, and of a length proportioned
to the Part. This muſt be rolled at one end only, and apply'd on the
Compreſs to keep that on the Scarifications, over which you muſt make
ſeveral Turns or Rounds: After this, aſcending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending again
ſpirally, ſtill leaving one third part of the Roller below bare, and in the
laſt place ſix it with Pins at its ends. If the Operation be made with the
Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, put a Tent into the <hi>Cannula</hi> which remains in the Belly, and a
great Compreſs made of Rags three or four Times double, or more if you think
fit, and ſuſtain all with the <hi>Napkin</hi> and <hi>Scapular;</hi> the
manner of making and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying which, we have ſhewn in the
<hi>Gaſtroraphia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you have made the Operation with the Tap, there is no need
of Dreſſing. The Perforation is ſo ſmall, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot make their
way through. But if for more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity you have a mind to make one, you need
only apply a ſimple Compreſs on the Puncture, with a Bandage to keep it
on.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Patient muſt uſe a drying Dyet, ſuch as
Roaſted Meats. If you fear a Relapſe, purge from time to time with
Hydragogues, ſuch as <hi>Jalap</hi> in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from 10 <hi>gr.</hi> to 30,
<hi>Roſin of Jalap,</hi> from 6 to 12, <hi>Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> from 8 to 15 and
Priſans made with the Diureticks ſuch as Roots of <hi>Dwarf-Elder,</hi>

                     <hi>Bartholine Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 23. relates that
a young Fellow of 20 Years of Age, happened to have a <hi>Hydrops
Aſcites.</hi> The Swelling was ſo extraordinary large and ſhining, the
Water for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced its way through the Pores of the Skin to that degree, that all
the Clothes and Linen round was wetted with it, the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour abated, and after
returned, which Relapſe ſo weakned the Patient that it killed him. In
<hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 81. he tells us a Child not a year old dying
Hydropick, had the Skin ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a purpliſh brown colour, about the
Stomach, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and Groin. Fifteen pints of Water were drawn out of its Belly,
which was very Serous, Bilious and Stinking The <hi>Omentum</hi> was all
putrefied, the Stomach and Guts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated. It did not appear there ever had
been any <hi>Pancreas.</hi> The Meſaraick Veins were filled with a ſhining
glutinous matter. The Spleen was Monſtrous, had three Appendages, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to
the left Kidney, and the Kidneys were very large, the Liver had loſt its Red,
and was become Aſh-coloured diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundance of Seroſities upon
cutring it; The Cavities of the Liver and Spleen were filled with Water. The
Bile in the Gall-Bladder lookt bright like Gold, the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardium</hi> was
of the ſame Colour, and very much diſtended by a quantity of ſtinking
Water contained in it. Not one drop of Blood was to be found in the Heart, or
any of the other <hi>Viſcera,</hi> no Blood in the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> nor
the great Artery, but a Water like the waſhing of Fleſh. The Lungs were
flaggy and putrid. <hi>Blaſius</hi> relates, that having opened a young Girl
of two years of Age, who dyed of a <hi>Hydrops Aſcites,</hi> he drew out
Twenty nine pound of Water, all contained between the Muſcles and
<hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> the <hi>Viſcera</hi> being intire.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not imagine that all ſwellings of the Belly
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from Dropſies, ſince the laſt nam'd Author aſſures us, He
had opened a Woman whoſe Belly was as hard as a Stone; and when ſhe was
dead, was dry all over. The Skin, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles and <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> made
only one deformed Lump, not to be diſtinguiſhed from the Muſcles. The
parts all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were more than half an Ell in thickneſs, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
to the Bottom of the Belly. The External parts were all Cartilaginous, and the
Internal all full of Cancrous Ulcers.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Operation of the
<hi>Hydrocele.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>an opening the</hi> Scrotum, <hi>to let
the Water out of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Is a praeternatural quantity of Water contained in
it. The Reaſon of its collection there, is the ſame we have aſigned as
the Cauſe of a <hi>Hydrops Aſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> whither we ſhall remit the
Reader. The <hi>Hydrocele</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times follows upon an <hi>Aſcites,</hi>
in which caſe we muſt not think it always proceeds from the Water running
through the Productions of the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> for then it would ever be
lodged within the <hi>Tunica Vaginalis,</hi> whereas it frequently finds a
Paſſage between the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and the Muſcles, and ſo gets
into the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> Sometimes the Water is contained between the proper
Membranes of the Teſticle, or included in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> ſometimes
part is in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> or a Membrane adhering to it, which makes a
Double <hi>Hydrocele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Hydrocele</hi> be the effect of a <hi>Hydrops
Aſcites,</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration will be uſeleſs; becauſe the conſtant
Defluxion of Waters will ſtill produce it a new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hydrocele's</hi> not enſuing on Dropſies, ordinarily
proceed from the ſlow Motion of the Blood or its Diſſolution, as we have
above proved. Falls and Contuſions may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſethem, becauſe
the Blood ſtagnating in the part, gives the Seroſities time to ſeparate.
We may aſſign the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Circumvolutions of the Spermatick Veins, as
another Cauſe, which numerous windings, hinder the prompt circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the
Blood, and give the Redundant Serum liberty to ſink into, and diſtend the
<hi>Scrotum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of an <hi>Hydrocele</hi> are the Swelling of the Cods,
and the Tranſparence of the Tumour. <hi>Hydrocele's</hi> are often miſtaken
for true <hi>Hernia's;</hi> but we ſhall aſſign a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number of
Marks to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, in the Operation of the
<hi>Hernia.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>This is performed with the Tap, Lancet, Seton, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
Cautery.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42110:32"/>
                  <p>For making it with the Tap, let the Patient be ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or
ſitting, and let a Servant compreſs the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> keeping back the
Teſticle, to prevent its being hurt with the point of the Inſtrument. When
the Water is let out, draw out the <hi>Cannula,</hi> and the skin of the
Teſticles which contracts, will exactly cloſe the Aperture.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Hydrocele</hi> is only on one ſide of the
<hi>Scrotum,</hi> it is moſt commonly within the Tunicks of the Teſticle;
and is very painful, by reaſon of the great Tenſion of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes. To
make the Operation in this Species of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drocele,</hi> make the Aperture
with the Lancer, and let it be deep and large enough to let the Water out, and
apply proper Remedies to diſcuſs the Membranes ſwoln by the Humours
ſoaking into them.</p>
                  <p>The Aperture muſt be on the ſide of the Cods, and
inſtead of the Lancet, may be made with the Potential Cautery; which on this
occaſion is preferrable; becauſe there is leſs danger of hurting the
Teſticle in this way, and it inſenſibly waſts the Membranes, which in
time will be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the Suppuration. Lay a Cauſtick on the
place you deſign for your Orifice, and afterwards open the Eſcar with a
Lancet. The Waters being apt to blunt the point of the Cauſtick, if the
firſt do not make an Eſcar ſufficient, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply more. When the Slough is
ſeparated, fill the wound with Doſſils, and leave thoſe which cover its
Bottom, four or five days without taking them out. The end of letting them lie
in ſo long, is that the matter may grow ſharp, and ſooner waſt the
Tunicks which contain the Waters. Your firſt Care muſt be to procure a good
Digeſtion, and next to look well to the Healing of the Wound. In very young
Children, the Aperture is beſt made with the Lancet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Water
all at once.</p>
                  <p>To make the Operation with the <hi>Seton,</hi> paſs a Skain
of Thread through<note n="*" place="bottom">Needles are make for the purpoſe
much after this Form, and to be had at every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument-Markers.</note> a
Packers Needle, and paſs this through the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> drawing the
Thread now and then to diſcharge the Water. This way can only be practiſed
in the <hi>Scrotum;</hi> for if you ſhould Attempt it in the <hi>Tunica
Vagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lis,</hi> the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of the Thread againſt the Teſticles, would cauſe a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inflammation.
I think the Lancet or the Tap preferable to this.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42110:32"/>
                  <p>In all Caſes where the Cods require Suſpenſion, you
muſt make uſe of a Bag Truſs. This is nothing elſe but a Bag with four
Tails or Straps, the upper of which go round the Patients Body, the lower
between his Legs, and are faſtned behind to the Waſtband. This Bag muſt
have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture before for the Yard to paſs through.</p>
                  <p>You may make a Suſpenſory Bandage which ſhall be more
commondious, and keep the Cods up better after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Take a peice of
Linne Cloath three Inches broad, and about four or five Inches long, divide it
below to the middle, then ſow above on each ſide two little ſtrings, near
an Inch broad, and long enough to go round the Patients Body, and two more
below to paſs between the Thighs, and be tyed behind to thoſe which go
round the Waſt; Theſe muſt croſs each other in paſſing between the
Leggs.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Apertion being no more than a palliative Cure, you
muſt have Recourſe to a good Drying Diet, ſuch as are all Roaſted
Meats. Give Diuretick Priſans made with the <hi>Roots</hi> of
<hi>Dwarf-Elder,</hi> Iris Gratiola, <hi>Wild Cowcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Leaves of Soldanella
and Chervil, Roots of Butchers Broom, Polypody, Garden-Flags, Chriſtal
Mineral, Saffron, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradients infuſed in White Wine
make an excellent Medicine, as we have noted in the Chap. of the Dropſie.

               <p>HErnias are <hi>Praeternatural Tumours cauſed by the falling
down of ſome</hi> Viſcera <hi>of the lower Belly, or a Flux of Humours.
Hernias</hi> differ according to the parts affected. If this ſwelling is in
the Navel, it is called <hi>Exomphalos,</hi> if in the Groin
<hi>Bubonocele;</hi> if in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> it is a perfect
<hi>Hernia;</hi> if it happen in other parts of the Belly, it is called
<hi>Hernia Ventralis;</hi> if caus'd by the falling of a part of the Guts
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terocele;</hi> if by the Omentum <hi>Epipocele,</hi> if by the Gut and
<hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> both <hi>Eutoroepiplocele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hernias</hi> are again divided into <hi>Genuine</hi> and
<hi>Spurious.</hi> They are Genuine or true, when the ſwelling is made by a
Part; and <hi>Spurious</hi> or <hi>Baſtard,</hi> when they proceed from
Waters, Wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The firſt are called <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> the
latter <hi>Pneuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocele,</hi> which ſhall all be explained hereafter. Some
again are Compleat, when the parts fall into the <hi>Scrotum</hi> in Men, and
the Lips of the <hi>Pudendum</hi> in Women; others Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, when they do
not fall lower than the Groin.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Cauſes are <hi>External</hi> or
<hi>Internal.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The External Cauſes are Violent Blows, Rude Shaking, Long
Races, Dancing, Leaping, continual Bawling, Frequent Debauches with Women, and
generally all violent Exerciſes. The Internal Cauſes are firſt the
copious Defluxion of Sero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities ſeparated from the Glands of the Guts,
Groin and <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> which plentifully watering theſe parts,
diſpoſe them to yield to all Impulſions. The ſecond cauſe is the
great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Fat and Oleous parts in the <hi>Omentum</hi> and
Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42110:33"/>which ſmear and greaſe the Fibres of the
<hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and by this means ſoften, relax, and diſpoſe them
to dilate and yield to the Motion, and puſhing forwards of thoſe parts
which form <hi>Hernias.</hi> For this reaſon all Perſons who eat much Oyl
in their Diet, are more ſubject to inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of this kind than others.
Windy Dyer contributes very much to the Riſe of <hi>Hernias;</hi> for the
included Air by its Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction diſtends the Guts, which puſh forward on
the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> and enter its Productions.</p>
                  <p>Hydropical Bodies, and Bigg-bellyed Women are ſubject to
<hi>Hernias;</hi> becauſe the Diſtention of the Womb in one, bears up the
Guts againſt the Diaphragm, and forms an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omphalos,</hi> and the Water
in the other ſoaks and relaxes the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and makes it
incapable after that is exhauſted of reſiſting the Guts; which force its
inner Membaane thro' the Rings of the Muſcles, and form a Bag which is more
or leſs elongated, as the impulſe is more ſtrong or feeble. Whence it
appears this Bag is not formed by the Productions which cover the Spermatick
Veſſels. The <hi>Hernia Ventralis</hi> happens in the
<hi>Aponeuroſis,</hi> [or Tendinous interſtices] of the ſtreight
Muſcles, the Belly riſing in ſuch a manner, that it cannot avoid dilating
thoſe weak parts, and ſometimes burſting them.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Hernias,</hi> do's not happen
ſo often as the <hi>Bubonocele;</hi> becauſe the Parts and Humours by their
own weight, have a natural tendence towards the Groin, and the Rings of the
Muſcles being open, the Parts eaſily ſlip in where they find little
Reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>THE SIGNS. In the firſt Species of <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> the
Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lodged between the Membrances of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> make a ſlight
Tenſion a conſiderable Tumour, and a moderate Weight. You may perceive an
Undulation by ſtriking on the Swelling with your Hand, and the Tranſparence
of the Water by ſetting a light behind it, the skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes tender, ſoft
and ſhining, without pain. In the ſecond kind the Waters are within the
Membrane of the Teſticles, there is great Pain and Tenſion, the Weight is
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in the Firſt, the Skin is not ſo much Diſtended, but has
ſeveral of its folds remaining; it is for the moſt part on one ſide, the

Theſe two Species may happen together.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of a <hi>Sarcocele</hi> are a great Hardneſs, an
intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Weight, an inſenſible Encreaſe of the Swelling. If 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42110:34"/>there be no Riſing in the Groin, it is a ſign the
Productions of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> are free from Cancrous Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>You may diſtinguiſh the <hi>Sarcocele</hi> from the
<hi>Hernia inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> the former being ſoft, and the latter hard.
This Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is ſometimes Schirrous, ſometimes Malignant; when it is
Schirrous, there is no ſenſe of Heat or Pain; when it is Malignant there is
both.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns of a <hi>Varicocele</hi> are a great Inequality,
Weight, Pain, Inſlammation, eſpecially if you uſe many Medicines to
moleſt it. This makes a Man impotent, when it ſiezes both Teſticles.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns of <hi>Circocele,</hi> (which is a Dilatation of
the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Veſſels in oppoſition to the <hi>Varicocele,</hi> in which
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal only are diſtended) are the ſame with the former, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that the Pain, Weight, Inflammation, are leſs; the Membranes of the
<hi>Serotum</hi> more diſtended, and the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling more apparent.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Pneumatocele</hi> the Swelling vaniſhes at ſome
times, and upon ſtriking ſounds like a Drum, has no Weight, Pain, or
Inflammation, is Tranſparent without changing the Colour of the Skin, and the
Wind is ſometime perceived higher, and ſometimes lower.</p>
                  <p>Recent <hi>Hernias</hi> made by the parts are moſt commonly
ſoft, without Inflammation or Change of Colour, and diſappear upon the
leaſt thruſting them back, xcept they proceed from ſome external Cauſe,
as Blows, Falls, or ſome indurated Excrements ſtopt in the Gut, or the free
paſſage of the Blood and Spirits into the Part be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, which
creates an Inflammation, often followed by a Mortification. For this Reaſon
the Surgeon muſt be careful not to handle theſe Tumours rudely, leaſt
ſuch ill conſequences may enſue. If there be a Deſcent of the Gut
without Inflammation, Strangulation or Adhaerence, the Swelling is Soft and
Uniform, the Colour of the Skin is not changed, and it diſappears when the
Patient lies on his Back; and when the Gut is reduced into the Belly, there is
a diſcernible Noiſe. If the <hi>Omentum</hi> is the Cauſe of the Tumour,
it is ſofter than if it be the Gut, and is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily thruſt in, it
is very uneven by reaſon of the Fat, and if it be preſt with the Finger the
the Impreſſion remains, the Reſiſtance is the ſame as in a
Steatomatous Humour; and there is great danger of Mortification, becauſe the
<hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> is ſpungy, and loaded with Fat. The Gut is inflamed, and
the <hi>Omentum</hi> turns livid upon the leaſt Alteration.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42110:34"/>
                  <p>The moſt dangerous Accidents which happen in theſe ſort
of Swellings, are the Inflammation which is always attended with Pain, Fever,
Strangulation of the Gut, and ſometimes the <hi>Miſerere,</hi> in which all
the Excrements of the Body are forced up, and voided through the Mouth. This
Symptom proceeds from the Faeces being too long retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gut and
hardned there, hindring the free ſupply of Blood and Spirits to the part,
which increaſing in Bulk ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a Strangulation; hence follows the
inverted Motion of the Inteſtinal Contents, the Lividity and Mortification of
the Parts. This Diſcoloration happens when the Swelling has been too much
handled and compreſſed, and the ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pain diſcovers the
parts to be Mortified.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Bubonocele</hi> and perfect <hi>Hernia</hi> the
Tumour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſappears, and ſometimes is permanent. If it
diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, it is a ſign there is no adherence, and the Gut ſuffers no
Compreſſion. In this Caſe Bandage and proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſufficient
for the Cure. If the Tumour be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, this proceeds from Inflammation,
Adheſion or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hardned in the Gut. Here nothing can be effected
without manual Operation.</p>
                  <p>The Gut cannot contract an Adherence to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Bag, which makes the <hi>Hernia,</hi> except it be corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome
ſharp Humour. This Bagg adheres ſometimes to the Sheath, which inveſts
the Spermatick Veſſels, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times to the <hi>Omentam,</hi> the Rings
of the Muſcles, the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos,</hi> or the Membranes of the Teſticle.</p>
                  <p>It is very dangerous when the Gut adheres to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and if it be of any ſtanding, it is ſcarce poſſible to cure it, without
Amputation of the Teſticle.</p>
                  <p>You may conclude the Gut adheres if the Tumour has not for a
long time ſubſided, and the Patient feels great Pain and Weight in the
Teſticle.</p>
                  <p>If there be a Deſcent of the Gut into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi>
and it be retained there for a long Time without returning, it is probable that
the Bag which contains it, is fixed to the Teſticles by the glutinous Humours
diſtilling from the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> and the Membranes of the
Teſticles which being thickned by the Heat of the part, and drying unite them
very ſtrictly, and make the Operation neceſſary to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>The Operations of the <hi>Bubonocele</hi> and the compleat
<hi>Hernia,</hi> are in a manner the ſame, and for that Reaſon, I ſhall
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them both in one Chapter.</p>
                  <p>To perform this Operation, oblige the Patient to lie on his
Back, with his Hips a little raiſed, then pinch up the Skin which lies over
the Swelling. A Servant muſt hold this at one end, and your ſelf at the
other. Then with a ſharp Knife in your Right Hand, make the Inciſion on the
Tumour following the Fold of the Groyn, when the Skin is cut, the Fat appears,
which you muſt tear of with your Nails or an Inſtrument, as well as the
<hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> for fear of cutting the Guts; and when you have
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Bag which makes the <hi>Hernia,</hi> tear it with it with
your Nails or Inſtrument as before.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes this Bag is found full of Water, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
muſt not ſurprize the Operatour, who may be apt to fear, that Water
iſſues from the wounded Gut. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Apprehenſion, he muſt
conſider well the Signs which diſtinguiſh the Gut from this Bag.</p>
                  <p>The Colour of the Gut is Browniſh, by reaſon of its
nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Blood-Veſſels, it forms a ſort of Arch, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
when it lies bare, and the Swelling is abated. The Gut is thicker than the
<hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> becauſe it is compoſed of four Tunicks; but this
laſt ſign is Ambiguous, the Bag formed by the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>
ſometimes hapning to be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Thickneſs. A Thick Foetid
Matter ever diſtills from the Gut when it is wounded, but that which comes
from the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is clear and limpid. If you draw the Gut to you
it obeys, except it happen to adhere to the Neighbouring parts, but the
<hi>Peritonaeum</hi> yields little. The Patient feels a dull Pain till the Gut
be diſcovered. Theſe are the ſigns which diſtinguiſh the
<hi>Peritonaeum</hi> from the Gut.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Gut does not adhere to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi>
and here it is you muſt ſhew your Dexterity to avoid engaging the Gut,
which you muſt draw a little forth, when it happens to be expoſed, to ſee
whether it adheres to the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and Rings, or not. When you are
ſure it is free in every place, manage it gently with your finger, to make it
enter more eaſily; this is done to diminiſh its Builk, and break the
Excrements, which cauſe its Tenſion; <pb n="41" facs="tcp:42110:35"/>after this put it
into the Belly with the two forefingers, thruſting them alternately into the
Ring. But if the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation be very conſiderable, dilate it with an
Inciſion Knife on the Furrow of the Director. It is the Ring of the External
oblique, which being lower than the others, cauſes the Strangulation,
becauſe the Tendinous Fibres of the <hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> of that Muſcle,
cannot recede to give place to the Carnous, and are more ſucceptible of
Inflammation, for this Reaſon only Scarifie that in this Operation. If you
cannot introduce your Probe for the great Strangulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; draw the Gut to you,
and put the forefinger of the left Hand above near the Ring, ſlip a ſmall
Inciſion-knife on the Nail, and make a Scarification there, to make way for
the entry of the Director, juſt to cut the edge of the Ring.</p>
                  <p>For if you ſhould proceed farther, you run a Risk of
cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſmall branch of an Artery, which paſſes through the
<hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> of the Muſcle, which you muſt carefully avoid. You
muſt cut inwardly without hurting the Teguments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the
<hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> of the Muſcle only, which cauſes the Strangulation.
When all is over, replace the Parts in the Belly, and to make a firm Cicatrix,
Scarifie the Ring which is Callous, if the <hi>Hernia</hi> be of any long

                     <head>The Operation of the Perfect <hi>Hernia.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>To perform this, Let the Patient lie on his Back, and make
an Inciſion with a Knife through the Skin on the ſide of the Thigh the
whole length of the Swelling, raiſing the Skin as before, you holding one
end, and a Servant the other, ſeparate the Lips of the wound, and break with
your Fingers or Fleam, the Coats which cover the Gut and Teſticle. The Gut
being diſcover'd, introduce a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor between the Membranes of the
<hi>Scrotum</hi> and it, and widen the Aperture with your Sciſſors, which
you muſt ſlide on the Furrow, and when you have laid bare, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it
from the Teſticle, to which it adheres. Next let a Servant hold up the Gut,
and draw it gently with his Hands toward the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> whilſt you
lightly draw the Teſticle with your Hand, to get the liberty of breaking with
a Fleam, or the point of your Knife, the Membranous Ties which unite the
Teſticle to the Gut.</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:42110:36"/>
                     <p>But here obſerve if the Adheſion be very ſtrict, it is
more adviſable to hurt the Teſticle than the Gut, becauſe that is not
neceſſary to Life, whereas if the Inteſtine be cut, the Patient can
hardly eſcape. You muſt have a great care likewiſe to avoid cutting the
Spermatick Veſſels, becauſe the Flux of Blood will obſtruct the
Operation.</p>
                     <p>After you have ſeparated the Gut from the Teſticle,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Director between the Skin and the Gut, and cut the Ring of the
Muſcle, which you muſt ſcarifie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Gut from its
Strangulation, in caſe it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. In the laſt place reduce the
Gut into the Belly in the ſame manner as in the <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> and when
it is repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, command a Servant to preſs the Belly with his Hand, to
prevent its falling out again.</p>
                     <p>It is a ridiculous Aſſertion, that the Teſticle muſt
always be extirpated after the Operation; for this do's not conduce to the Cure
of the <hi>Hernia;</hi> on the contrary it prolongs it, puts the Patient to
unneceſſary Trouble, and deprives him of the means of ſatisfying the
Duties of his Sex; nay, if the Teſticle happen to be affected, it is moſt
adviſable to defer the Operation till the Fluxion be abated, in which ſpace
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that may be cured.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Omentum</hi> alone adheres and covers part
of the Teſticle, and ſometimes the Gut with the <hi>Omentum</hi> lying over
it. In this caſe you muſt dextrouſly free the Gut from the Teſticle,
and leave a ſmall portion of the <hi>Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> adhering to either of
them, rather than endanger the hurting them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Omentum</hi> is almoſt ever corrupted, and for
this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a Ligature muſt be made, and the tainted part taken of.
Sometimes indeed in Recent <hi>Hernia's,</hi> there is not time enough to admit
of any alteration, and then you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place it in the Belly without farther
trouble. If the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> cleave to the Gut, and there be no change
diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it, reduce both together without taking off any part of the
former. If both together adhere to the Bag of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> take
off part of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> rather than touch the Gut, and if it
cannot be otherwiſe diſengaged, as when the <hi>Omentum</hi> adheres to the
Bag, it is better to take off part of the laſt, than the firſt. But the
<hi>Omentum</hi> being unable to remain long in that State without being
altered, it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens but that ſome part is requiſite to be cut
off.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42110:36"/>
                     <p>In making a Ligature on the <hi>Omentum,</hi> you muſt be
care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to make it too ſtraight, becauſe it eaſily cuts through it,
by reaſon of itsſoftneſs. You muſt turn the Threadſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times
round, firſt paſſing the Needle through its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>THE DRESSING. Thruſt into the Wound a long Tent of Linen
capped at one end, and flat at the other; for if you uſe Lint only, the Guts
which are always driving down, will not fail to dilate the Ring, and hinder a
good <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> and the Inteſtines will fall down again after the
Wound is healed. Here obſerve to paſs a Thread through your Tent to draw it
out at pleaſure, and hinder it from ſinking into the Belly. Next fill the
Wound with Doſſils armed with good Digeſtives made with <hi>Turpentine
and Yelks of Eggs,</hi> over them lay a Triangular Emplaſter, and a large
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of the ſame Figure, Embrocate well the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parts with

                     <p>This is made with a Roller rolled at one end, which muſt

of the Roller on the Wound, then paſs on to the Back, returning to the Belly,
thence over the wound, thence between the Thighs, thence over the Wound, thence
behind the Back, thence over the Wound, then over the Belly, then over the
Thigh, then between the Thighs, then over the Wound, then behind the Back,
continuing to make theſe rounds till the Roller is ſpent; and laſtly

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Operation of the
<hi>Exomphalos.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Exomphalos is a <hi>praeternatural Tumour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
made by the extruſion of ſome of the</hi> Viſcera.</p>
               <p>The Operation is <hi>an Inciſion made on the Tumour to
reſtore the Parts to their Natural place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSES. To have a right Knowledge of the Cauſe of this
Diſtemper, it is requiſite to conſider the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Navil. This
is formed by the uniting of the Umbilical Veſſels, which obliquely
ſliding into the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> are accompanyed with that, and both
together ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through the <hi>Linea alba,</hi> terminate in the Surface
of the Skin. The Ways through which theſe paſs, are no leſs viſible in
the <hi>Foetus,</hi> than the Rings in the Muſcles of the Lower Belly in
Adults; but after the Birth the Veſſels dry, ſhrink degenerate into
Ligaments, and are no longer pervious, and the contiguous parts encreaſing,
while theſe remain unalter'd, the Navil is neceſſarily pulled in by them.
The difference between Umbilical and the Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Chanels in the latter are
permeable diſtinct, and eaſily ſeparable from each other. The former
impervious, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the Tendinous Fibres of each
<hi>Aponeuroſis</hi> ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced with each other, they ſeem to
compoſe one Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42110:37"/>Body. Beſides we may obſerve,
the Navil is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a Circle deſtitute of Carnous Fibres, for
half a Fingers breadth round, all which circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in forming an
<hi>Exomphalos,</hi> and differ very little from thoſe deſcribed in the
<hi>Bubonocole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. If the Gut is the Cauſe of this Swelling, it is
called <hi>Enteromphalos;</hi> if the <hi>Omentum Epiplompalos;</hi> if Water
<hi>Hydromphalos;</hi> if Wind <hi>Pneumatomphalos;</hi> if Fleſh
<hi>Sarcomphalos;</hi> and <hi>Vaicomphalos</hi> if it be the Veſſels. If
it be a <hi>Hydromphalos,</hi> the Swelling is pliant, and yields to the
impreſſion of the Fingers; you may diſcover it to be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, by
ſetting a Candle behind the Water, it makes a ſmall noiſe if you ſtrike
on the part, and you may perceive its Motion. The <hi>Pneumatomphalos</hi>
yields to the Fingers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, returning to the ſame Magnitude;
reſounds if you ſtrike on it, and it is always equal, and of the ſame
Figure in whatever Poſture the Patient be put. The <hi>Sarcomphalos</hi> is
hard, the Swelling is large, and does not yield to compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The
<hi>Enteromphalos</hi> is a Tumour a little Hard, with Tenſion, narrow at the
Baſis, and Swelling out if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent holds his Breath, it abates if you
preſs it with your Hand, making a little noiſe in the Subſiding, which is
more ſenſible if the Patient be laid on his Back when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is made. In the <hi>Epiplomphalos,</hi> the Tumor is ſofter and larger on one
ſide than the other. Its Baſis is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in Compreſſing it
ſubſides without the leaſt noiſe.</p>
               <p>This is more dangerous if an Inflammation ariſe and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an
Abſceſs, which coming to break the <hi>Viſcera</hi> force out of the
Belly. Infants are more eaſily cured of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes than Perſons
advanced in years, and Ancient People ſeldom recover. Children have their
Fleſh more ſoft and ſpungy than Adults, and theſe ſtill more than old
Bodies, which very much aſſiſts the Cure.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Before you begin, you muſt remove all impediments of the
Reunion of the Parts, ſuch as Inflammation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the Guts with
Excrements or Wind.</p>
                  <p>The Inflammation muſt be diſcuſſed by Bleeding, and
Unction with <hi>Oyl of Roſes, Lilies;</hi> the Guts cleared from Wind or
Excrement by Clyſters, with Decoctions of the Emollient Herbs, as
<hi>Mallows, Marſh-Mallows, Pellitory of the Wall,</hi> with a Thouſand
others of the like nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <pb n="46" facs="tcp:42110:38"/>the reſt; you
muſt not forget to put in <hi>Aniſeſeeds</hi> bruiſed, and give the

Operation.</p>
                  <p>To perform this, the Patient lying on his Back, pinch up the
Fleſh which covers the Tumour, one end of which a Servant muſt hold, and
your ſelf the other, then with a ſharp Knife make an Inciſion the length
of the Swelling, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care not to hurt the Umbilical Veſſels,

ſo Tenſe that it cannot be pinched up, make an Inciſion with a ſharp
Knife to the Fat, which you muſt tear with your Nails or Fleam; for you
muſt not make your Inciſion deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for fear of wounding the Inteſtines.
When the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is laid bare, draw it up with your Nails, to
make a ſmall aperture with your Sciſſors, then put the forefinger of your
left Hand into this aperture, to guide the point of the Sciſſors or Knife,

                  <p>If the <hi>Omentum</hi> adheres to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi>
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage it, directing your Knife more toward the former than the latter.
If the Guts adhere to the <hi>Omentum,</hi> you muſt be careful in freeing
them not to hurt them, leaving ſome part of the <hi>Omentum</hi> cleaving to
them. Sometimes there is a Carnous Maſs appended to the Gut, which muſt be
removed as well as all that part of the <hi>Omentum</hi> which is corrupted; in
order to this make a Ligature in the Sound part, and all the reſt with your
Sciſſors or Knife. Next reduce all the parts into the Belly, and to procure
a firm cloſe Cicatrix, Scarifie all round the Lips of the Wound. Then make
the interrupted Suture, obſerving all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances directed in the
<hi>Gaſtroraphia,</hi> or ſtitching of the Belly.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Operation is an <hi>Amputation of the Teſticle.</hi> THE
CAUSE. Divers Caſes may happen where all other Methods will be ineffectual:
as for inſtance, When the Teſticle adheres firmly to the Gut, and cannot be
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated without loſs of Subſtance: When in great Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the
<hi>Veſſels</hi> and <hi>Veſiculae</hi> are cruſhed, and the influx of
the Blood is intercepted: When there is a Varicoſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which cannot
be diſcuſſed by the uſual Applications, or laſtly when the Part is
infeſted with ſome Excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of long ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Theſe Excreſcences are ſometimes in the Subſtance of the
Teſticle, and ſometimes on its Membranes only; and ſeem to be form'd out
of the more Oyly and Viſcid part of the Blood, imported by the Spermatick
Arteries, which eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping through the Poroſities of the Veſſels, is
harden'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed by the Heat of the Part: This Extravaſated Matter
being lodg'd in the ſmall Tubes, grows Acrimonious, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes, huffs up and
diſtends them, and ſo produces Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous and Cancrous Swellings.</p>
               <p>When the external Membranes are affected, they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the
Cancroſity to the Productions of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and ſometimes it
extends to the parts contain'd within the Cavity of the Belly: But in this
caſe the Operation is uſeleſs, ſince not being confined to the
<hi>Tunica Vaginalis,</hi> you muſt deſtroy the Veſſels, Rings, and
other Parts contained in the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> to extirpate it.</p>
               <p>Whatever is apt to cauſe obſtructions, may create an
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in this Part: Thus Seed infected with the Pocky Malignity,
ſometimes ferments and tumefies the Teſticles.</p>
               <p>If a Compleat <hi>Hernia</hi> made by Deſcent of the Gut,
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen when there is any Ulcer or Carnoſity in the Teſticle, the Sanious
Matter iſſuing from them, excoriates the Gut, and glews it ſo firmly to
the Teſticle, that it is impoſſible to ſeparate them without taking off
the latter. Contuſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome external Cauſe, ſuch as
Blows, Falls or Cruſhes, which Accidents break the Veſſels, and the Blood
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42110:40"/>and Humours ſtagnating in the Parts create Tumours,
Abſceſſes and Ulcers.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of an Adhaeſion of the Teſticle to the Gut, is
manifeſt to the Naked Eye, when Part of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is deſtroyed, and
taken off to free the Gut, and make the Operation in a perfect <hi>Hernia.</hi>
The Sign which without opening the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> demonſtrates the
adhaeſion of the Teſticle to the Gut, is that the Gut has remained for
ſome time in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> without re-entring the Belly, which yet is
not very certain. You may conclude the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticle is bruiſed, if the Patient
feel a violent Pain, and after ſome blow or cruſh it ſwells.
Excreſcences are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by their Bigneſs, Weight and Hardneſs.</p>
               <p>Swellings of the Teſticles are to be feared, becauſe
Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes and Schirroſities frequently follow, if Reſolvents have
been omitted in the beginning. Inflammations of the Teſticles are dangerous,
becauſe they uſually terminate in Abſceſſes, and ſometimes
gangrene.</p>
               <p>There remain frequently Schirrous Swellings after Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which incommode the Patient all his Life, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Teſticle
mortifies. If the Swelling be Hard, Schirrous, Painful, and Inflamed, or be of
long ſtanding, and both Teſticles are affected, the Operation will be
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Place the Patient on his Back, with his Buttocks raiſed
higher than his Head, and his Legs ſtradling, which muſt be held by two
Servants.</p>
                  <p>Pinch up the Skin of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and let a Servant
hold it at one end, and your ſelf at the other, make an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
lengthways, (or without pinching the Skin, let the Inciſion be made on the
Body of the Teſticle) Then free free the Carnoſity from the
<hi>Dartos,</hi> which inveſts the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticle without hurting the Cover of
the Spermatick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and make a Ligature betwixt the Rings and the
Swelling. Cut about a fingers breadth below the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and take off the
Teſticle with the <hi>Sarcoma,</hi> leaving the End of the Thread hanging out
of the Wound, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing down or compreſſing the Spermatick
Veſſels, leaſt you throw the Patient into a Convulſion.</p>
                  <p>If the Cancroſity ſpread it ſelf on the Productions of
the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> conſume the Superfluous Fleſh by Cauſticks, or
waſt it with ſtrong Suppuratives before you proceed to the 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42110:40"/>Operation. When the proud Fleſh is removed, and the
Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car ſeparated, make a Ligature on the Spermatick Veſſels near the
Rings of the Muſcles, and ſo take off the Teſticle. If the Ligature be
made before the ſeparation of the Eſcar, the Patient will be convulſed.
If the Carnous Excreſcence be moveable, and do's not adhaere to the
Teſticle, free it and chooſe rather to leave ſome little part of this
Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence remaining on the Body of the Teſticle than endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hurting
it. If any Veſſels appear, make the Ligature before you cut the
Excreſcence off.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Fill the Wound with Doſils armed with a good
Digeſtive, Embrocate with Anodynes, Apply Compreſſes dipt in
Defenſative Liquors, as <hi>Oxycrat</hi> or <hi>Red-wine</hi> very Hot, and
laſtly keep the Applications on with the Bag-Truſs deſcribed in the
<hi>Hydrocele.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Digeſt the Wound for ſome time with
<hi>Turpentine, and the Yelk of Eggs,</hi> to procure a good
<hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrix,</hi> and conſume the remains of the ſuperfluous Fleſh. If
you perceive any Inflammation, have recourſe to Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Clyſters. Be
ſure to keep the Wound clean, and when you obtain a laudable <hi>Pus</hi>
begin to cicatrize; The Patient muſt abſtain from all things Salt, Acid, or

               <p>THIS Operation is an <hi>Inciſion of the Prepuce, to give way
for denuding the</hi> Glans.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE which makes this Inciſion neceſſary, is a
contraction of the Prepuce, which ſtrongly compreſſes the <hi>Glans</hi>
of the Yard, which except it be diſengaged, becomes inflamed and
mortifies.</p>
               <p>This Impriſonment of the <hi>Glans</hi> is ſometimes
Natural, and proceeds from its being wrapt in the Prepuce, and not freed from
it by any Venereal Exerciſe or Handling. When this Diſeaſe is Natural,
the Prepuce forms ſeveral Wrinkles, between which a Tenacious Slimy Matter is
lodged, which ariſes from the <hi>Glans,</hi> and glews the Prepuce very
ſtrictly to it, ſcarce leaving a Paſſage for the Urine. Sometimes this
Diſeaſe is Accidental, and proceeds from ſome Inflammation, Chancre,
Wart, Schirroſity, or Unskilful Uſe of Corroſive Medicines; but whatever
the Cauſe be, the free Circulation of the Blood is interrupted, the Part
exceedingly inflamed, and the Fibres of the Prepuce very ſtiff and
ſtubborn.</p>
               <p>The vehement Pain proceeds from the Thinneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
Senſe of the Membrane of the <hi>Glans,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, and
interwoven with a multitude of Nerves; which Structure renders it very
ſenſible, when it is moleſted by any Pungent or Corroſive Matter.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. This Diſeaſe is evident, The Patient finds great
Difficulty in making Urine, has violent Pains, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uncover the
<hi>Glans,</hi> and moſt commonly a Matter like Plaſter is lodged between
it and the Prepuce.</p>

                  <p>Obſerve here in all Diſeaſes of the Yard, (and ſo in
the uſe of theſe Medicines) it is very Commodious to lay it on the Belly,
and keep it Suſpended in this Poſture by a ſmall Bandage, the
Deſcription of which the Reader may find in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>If the Prepuce be firmly united to the <hi>Glans,</hi> which
is known by the Skin not being brought over, and no Probe paſſing between
it and the <hi>Glans,</hi> the Operation will be dangerous, and cannot be done
without firſt diſengaging the Prepuce from the <hi>Glans,</hi> and creating
a great deal of Pain, and endangering a Mortification of the Yard.</p>
                  <p>When you judge the Caſe will admit of Operation, Let the
Patient ſtand or ſit as you like beſt. Draw the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Prepuce
as far back as you can, and command an Aſſiſtant to keep the Skin down at
the Root of the Yard, (that the Inciſion may reach exactly to the bottom of
the <hi>Glans</hi>) then introduce a ſmall Inciſion-knife, with a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of Wax on its point (to prevent wounding the part) under the Prepuce, and cut
through it. If one Inciſion be not ſufficient, make another on the
oppoſite ſide.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay on the Wound a ſmall Pledgit arm'd with
ſome good Balſam, and over this a Compreſs in form of a Croſs,
perforated in the midſt for the paſſage of the Urine; and keep theſe on
with a narrow Fillet near three quarters of an inch broad. This Fillet muſt
be of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient length to cover the whole Yard by its Circumvoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
have a Hole made at one end, and the other end ſlit lengthways above an inch
and a half. In applying this, paſs the two Tails or Slit end through the Hole
at the other end, then draw it as ſtrait as is convenient; make ſeveral
Circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpirally, till the whole Yard be cover'd, and the Fillet
ſpent, and then faſten it by the two Tails.</p>
                  <p>If you judge it neceſſary to cover the Pledgit with an
Emplaſter, make this of the ſame Figure, and let it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated in the
midſt like the Compreſs.</p>
                  <p>For the Patients eaſe, and to prevent the Inflammation of
the Part, make a Linnen Caſe of an equal length with the Yard, and large
enough to contain it with all its Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: Let this Caſe have a
Perforation at the end for the paſſage of the Urine, ſtitch two ſmall
ſtraps at the lower end on each ſide, and one to the upper, which may be
long enough to be faſtned to the Band which goes round the Waſt to
ſuſpend the Yard, and prevent Pain and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42110:42"/>
                  <p>This Caſe is of ſingular uſe to prevent painful Erection
in Priapiſms, Virulent Gonorrhaeas, Heats of Urine, and other Diſeaſes
incident to this Part.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE do's not differ from the uſual Method, in all
ſimple Wounds. For inſtance, If any Inflammation ariſe, have Recourſe
to Bleeding, Cooling Clyſters, and a Regular Diet, and when the Wound is

Relates the Hiſtory of a Young Man of 22 Years of Age, who from his Infancy
bad a Prepuce of a monſtrous Size, contorted before in ſuch a manner, that
in the emiſſion of his Urine the ſtream was diverted on one ſide, and
wetted his Cloaths. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce was not Membranous, as it ordinarily is, but a
Carnous Subſtance, and when he made Water, a great part of the Urine was
detained by it; to prevent which, he was obliged to draw the <hi>Glans</hi> out
with his Fingers. This conſtant Handling made the Yard ſwell
prodigiouſly, and the inferior part commonly call'd the Suture, was exceeding
Tenſe and Horney. The Author cut off this Prepuce cloſe to the
<hi>Glans,</hi> and the Patient was happily cured of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.

               <p>THIS Operation is the <hi>Reducing the Prepuce over the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSES. The Strangulation of the <hi>Glans</hi> is caus'd
ſometimes by a ſimple Retraction of the Skin, which forms a Roll round the
Yard, and at other times by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Prepuce, from ſome
preceeding Cancre or Tumour. The Yard is often exceedingly ſwoln, and there
are two or three Rolls one over another, which mightily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Refluent
Blood. When this happens, it is almoſt <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42110:42"/>ever attended with
a ſwelling in the lower part of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce, fill'd with a reddiſh Water,
rarified and converted into a windy Matter by the Heat of the Part.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of a <hi>Paraphymoſis</hi> are a Tumour of the Yard
and Rolls on the Prepuce. There is ſometime an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable ſwelling under
the Prepuce, filled with a reddiſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which riſes to ſuch a Height,
that except you Scarifie deeply the tumified place, to give a diſcharge to
the Part, the Yard neceſſarily Mortifies.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To reduce the <hi>Prepuce,</hi> you muſt uſe both
forefingers and both Middle fingers. Place theſe beneath the Rolls, formed by
the tumefied Prepuce, and with the two Thumbs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſides of the
<hi>Glans,</hi> to leſſen its Bulk, and ſo draw on the Prepuce. You
muſt not thruſt back the end of the <hi>Glans,</hi> to make the Prepuce
come over it; becauſe it enlarges it ſelf, which hinders Reduction. If the
Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be very great, and renders this Method impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, apply
Compreſſes dipt in <hi>M. Lemeries,</hi> or ſome other Styptick Water,

                     <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> informs us, He cured a
<hi>Paraphymoſis</hi> in very Plethorick Gentlemen by the following Method.
In the firſt place to keep the Patients Body cool, he enjoyned him to ſhun
all manner of ſtrong Drink, purged him with Cholagogues, and bled him
copiouſly in the Arm; then he applyed a cooling Liniment twice a Day to the
Region of the Kidneys, and the following Cataplaſm as often to the
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Part. ℞. <hi>Barley Flower</hi> ℥iv. <hi>Powder of
Roſes,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Pomgranat Flowers and Cypreſs Nuts,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i.
<hi>Boyl the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in Roſe and Plantain Water. Make a Cataplaſm with
theſe, with the Addition of Yelks of Eggs, which is to be repeated twice a
Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Application being continued for ſeveral Days, the
Pain abated very much. But a great erection happening one Night, obſtructed
the Cure, and the Prepuce violently compreſſing the <hi>Glans,</hi> all the
Symptoms encreaſed. Upon this he ordered him to forbear all Commerce with his
Wife, not permitting him ſo much as ſee with her, <pb n="56" facs="tcp:42110:43"/>purged him with Cholagogues, uſing outwardly the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

Beſides this he gave him a Doſe of <hi>Laudanum</hi> after Supper, after
which he had better Repoſe than ordinarily, and the Erection was leſs

exceeded two Grains, and outwardly to uſe the Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above deſcribed,

the Patient was cured, and had ſeveral Children after. But we muſt not omit
here his caution to young Practitioners not to uſe the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm above

Tells us, a certain Smith of 40 years of Age of a Melancholick Habit, had a
ſmall Wart on the extremity of his Prepuce of the bigneſs of a Vetch. This
Man being Marryed, found a great and continual Pain in this Excreſcence upon
the embraces of his Wife, which obliged him to forbear knowing her for thirteen
Years. The Pain increaſed by little and little, and at laſt degenerated
into a Horrible Cancer, as big as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Head. The whole Yard became a
Huge deformed Maſs of Fleſh, with ſeveral Ulcers on its Surface, thro'
which the Patient diſcharged his Urine: The noiſom ſcent of this
<hi>Cancer</hi> was ſo great, that no one could endure to come near it. The
Author made an Amputation of the Yard, and cured him perfectly.</p>

               <p>There is no Animal, except Man alone, infeſted with this
Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Ancients did believe the Stone to be formed by
the more Viſcid and Faeculent parts of the Blood paſſing off with the
Urine, and ſetling in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is perſwaded, it
proceeds from the more Terreſtrial and Heavy parts of the Urine it ſelf,
which in too long a Retention of it, ſubſide and ſink to the bottom of
the Bladder, like Sand in a Veſſel of Water, and are there bound together
by a thick ſlimy Matter, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Maſs, in proceſs of Time
encreaſes by the ſupply of new Materials. <hi>Fernelius</hi> conceives, all
Stones are firſt form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Kidneys, and fall from thence by the Ureters
into the Bladder. This Opinion he founds upon an Obſervation, That he had
ſeen no Perſon afflicted with the Stone, who had not before felt Nephritick
Pains: This he farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, by aſſuring us, that in moſt great
Stones when bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, there is found a ſmall Kernel in the center, of the
ſame Colour and Conſiſtence with the Stone, and of a Figure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to
the Baſin of the Kidneys, and incloſed in a Caſe of a different Colour
from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Our Author ſeems to be miſtaken in
repreſenting <hi>Helmonts</hi> Opinion of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stone:
<hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> ſtir indeed, and that
with great Heat and Tumult, but after combine and compoſe a Temperate Liquor,
or <hi>Spiritus Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri dulcis.</hi> The true <hi>Helmontian</hi> Hypotheſis,
is that the <hi>Duelech</hi> or Animal Stone is formed by a Volatil Salt
coagulated by a Vinous Sulphur; which conjecture he forms on the Famous
Experiment of mixing Spirit of Wine and Spirit of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>urine both perfectly
dephlegm'd (for the leaſt Aquoſity remaining, defeats the Tryal) both which
Liquids in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly coagulate into a Hard, Dry Subſtance, which he calls
<hi>Offa Alba.</hi> See <hi>Helmont de Lithiaſi.</hi>
                  </note>But the Modern
Chymiſts ſeem to me to frame the moſt plauſible Theory of the Formation
of the Stone in Animal Bodies. Theſe Gentlemen in Analyſiing the Urine by
Fire, <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42110:44"/>find in it two conſtituent Principles,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Urinous Salt of a Volatil and Nitrous Nature, and pure Sulphur
not unlike a Vinous Spirit. Now Experience ſhews us, That upon mixing Spirit
of Wine and Spirit of Nitre, a <hi>Coagulum</hi> will reſult in an inſtant;
it is very eaſie and natural to ſuppoſe, that the like Principles
exiſtent in the Urine, leaving their Superfluous Phlegm, may unite,
precipitate, and produce the like effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Van Helmout</hi> do's not think the Principles of the Urine
alone ſufficient, for the Production of the Stone; but adds a Petrifick
Ferment, which he places in the Kidneys and Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Veſſels, and reckons
up as a Third Agent, required to fix and coagulate the former. <hi>There is no
Tranſmutative principle in Nature,</hi> ſays that Author, <hi>without a
Ferment; The Inteſtine Motion of the Particles of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, is not the
immediate Cauſe of its Corruption; Its Putrefaction do's not ariſe from any
vitious Diſpoſition of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, but from a peculiar corruptive Ferment
reſiding in the Kidneys, and other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi> This he illuſtrates
by the Similitude of a Veſſel, in which any Acid Liquour has ſtood for
ſome Time, which Coagulates and ſours Milk; by Leaven which ferments Dough,
and by the Taint of a Muſty Veſſel, which alters and corrupts Wine, or
any Liquor put into it. This Ferment which for its fineneſs and ſubtilty,
bears ſome Analogy to the Odoriferous Steams iſſuing from Scented Bodies,
he calls it <hi>Odor</hi> or <hi>Scent;</hi> and of ſuch a Nature he pretends
the Ferment is, to whoſe Petrifying influence, he aſcribes the Origin of
the Stone; and to confirm the exiſtence of ſuch a Ferment, he alledges this
Experiment, That Urine will ſooner putrifie in a Veſſel tainted with it
before, than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother which is clean and new.</p>
               <p>Having laid down the neceſſity of a peculiar Ferment to
perfect this Work, he proceeds to Explicate the manner how it is performed. He
aſſures us, he has found in a Spagyrical Examen of the Urine a Nitrous
Spirit, which he terms the <hi>Coagulator,</hi> and another Spirit not unlike
Spirit of Wine. Beſides theſe, ſays he, There is in Urine a Terreſtrial
Styp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirit, which by the Aſſiſtance of the corruptive Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is
volatilized and imbibed by the Urinous Spirit, and theſe two uniting, excite
and put into Motion the Vinous Spirit, which before lay dormant in the Pores of
the Urine. At laſt after ſome conflict and mutual Action they combine
together, Praecipitate and Form a Stone in the midſt of the 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42110:44"/>Liquor. From hence he infers, Stones are form'd in an
Inſtant, and grow gradually; tho' ſometimes too he ſuppoſes they
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a conſiderable Addition in a Moment of Time.</p>
               <p>Ill Diet conduces much to the generation of the Stone; for
inſtance, all Spirituous Drinks, Sharp Sauces, Milk-Meats, Fruits, Rye-bread,
and the like; The latter upon the Account of their Foulneſs, and the former
upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Spirituous parts. The one furniſh Materials for
the Stone, and the otherr the Petrifick Ferment. Nature too oftentimes as well
as Diet, has a ſhare in this matter, and the Stone proceeds from ſome
Petrfying ſeeds we inherit from our Parents, and keep all our life after.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The Stones found in Humane Bodies differ very much,
as Small, Great, Smooth, Unequal, Flat, Round, Oval, Square, Hollow, Light,
Heavy, Hard or Soft; ſome have Kernels, others not; ſome are White, Gray,
Red, Black, Brown, or of other Colours; ſome adhere to the Parts, as the
Sides, Bottom or Neck of the Bladder, others are looſe; ſome are in the
Kidneys, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters,</hi> Bladder or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra;</hi> ſome are included
in <hi>Cyſtis</hi>'s, others not. In ſhort, they are found in all Parts of
the Body.</p>
               <p>If a Stone be lodged in the Kidneys, there is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,
a Violent and fixed Pain, (which encreaſes if you preſs the Part with your
Hand.) There is a Feaver and Suppreſſion of Urine, which deſtills drop by
drop, and ſometimes is Bloody, which proceeds from the fretting of the
Veſſels by the growing Stone. Muddy and Purulent Urines, diſcover the
Blood to be Extravaſated, and an Abſceſs in the Kidneys. In this caſe
Vomiting, a Stupor of the Thigh and Legenſue, and the Patient cannot endure
to keep his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtraight, the Teſticle of the ſame ſide is retracted
into the Groin, and ſometimes <hi>Pus</hi> is evacuated with the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for the purulent Matter corroding the Gut, runs thro' it, and paſſes off
with the <hi>Faeces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Communication between the Nerves of the Kidneys and Stomach,
and the agitation of the Spirits in the Carnous Fibres of the Stomach by the
Inflammation of the Kidneys, are the cauſes of the Vomiting.</p>
               <p>The Kidney lying on the Head of the Muſcle <hi>Pſoas,</hi>
compreſſes and inflames it, and this inflamed Muſcle preſſes the
great Trunk of the Nerves, (which paſſes through its ſubſtance, and is
diſtributed to the fore part of the Thigh and Hip,) and from hence proceeds
the <hi>Stupor,</hi> becauſe the free influx of the Spirits is interrupted.
The <hi>Pſoas</hi> and Iliac <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42110:45"/>Muſcle contiguous to it
being inflamed, (which two Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are the Benders of the Thigh) they cannot
obey or follow the motion of the Extenſors; and this is the reaſon the
Patient cannot keep himſelf erect, without enduring ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement pain. The Iliac
Muſcle being united to the <hi>Crema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> communicates its
Inflammation to it, which cauſing a contraction of the Fibres of the latter,
the Teſticle muſt of neceſſity aſcend to the Groin.</p>
               <p>But after all, theſe Symptoms concurring are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to give us an abſolute aſſurance there is a Stone in the Kidneys, ſince
they all may attend an ordinary Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that part, as in the caſe of
Nephritick Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
               <p>We diſcover that there is a Stone in the Bladder, by a lively
burning pain in Piſſing, and the Urine coming forth by drops, and after
divers intervals, as in the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury.</p>
               <p>The Stone ſometimes ſtops the Neck of the Bladder, and
ſometimes wholly blocks it up, according to the ſeveral Motions it receives
from the Urine; and this is the cauſe of theſe Intermiſſions. When the
Bladder is evacuated its ſides rub on the Stone, which grates them by its
hardneſs and inequality; and from hence proceed great Pains after Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and ſometimes drops of Blood. The Patient feels an itching in the
<hi>Perinaeum,</hi> which is continued to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the <hi>Glans,</hi>
and obliges him to rub it: This ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens from ſharpneſs of
Urine. The weight of the Stone is often felt, and the irritation of the Fibres
ſometimes cauſes an involuntary Erection of the Yard. The Urine is
ſometimes White, ſometimes Bloody, Thick, Turbid, Muddy, and full of
Sand.</p>
               <p>When the Urine is very clear, and there is Sand at the Bottom of
the Urinal, this is a ſign of a Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. If the Stone extracted
be polite and ſmooth, it is a ſign there are more, by rubbing againſt
which this ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is cauſed.</p>
               <p>If the Stone be very large, and reſts in the Neck of the
Bladder, it becomes equally large with its bottom. When it fixes to the bottom
of the Bladder, and is contained in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> the Patient may carry
it all his Life-time without any notable inconvenience, or the appearance of
any of the ſigns above recited.</p>
               <p>Among the Diagnoſtick ſigns, there is none more certain than
the Reſiſtance of the <hi>Catheter,</hi> and the diſcernable noiſe from
gently ſtriking on the Stone.</p>

The <hi>Catheter</hi> thus introduced, muſt be held by a Servant placed for
that purpoſe on one ſide of the Patient, who muſt hold it with both his
Hands, drawing up the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in ſuch a manner, that the back of
the <hi>Catheter</hi> which thruſts out the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> may be
between his two forefin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and leave ſpace enough for you to make your
Inciſion. The Inciſion muſt be made with a ſharp two edged Knife on one
ſide the Suture of the <hi>Perinaeum;</hi> which muſt be 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42110:46"/>greater or leſs, as you judge the Stone to be. To perform
this dexterouſly, hold your Knife like a Lancet, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in the moſt
prominent part, plunge it quite to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter,</hi> continuing to paſs
and repaſs it in the furrow of that Inſtrument, till you have laid as much
bare as you deſire. This caution is neceſſary, leaſt if the Inciſion
were made at ſeveral Times, there might be more than one Orifice.</p>
                  <p>In Men the Inciſion muſt be near two inches and an half
long, in Children leſs. It is better to have it too great, than to be obliged
to enlarge the wound with the Dilator, in caſe the Stone ſhould prove too
great to be extracted thro' the aperture, becauſe ſuch violent diſtention
tears and bruiſes the Fibres of the Bladder. The Inciſion if it be well
made muſt enter the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and you muſt not draw the
<hi>Catheter</hi> out of the Bladder, till you have ſlipt into its Furrow a
Gorget or two Conductors, on which the <hi>Forceps</hi> is after introduced;
for without the direction of theſe, you may eaſily miſtake and paſs
them aſide, which too often happens; and whilſt the Operator thinks he is
in it, and ſeeking the Stone feels it with his <hi>Forceps,</hi> inſtead of
that pulls the Bladder and often tears it. When the <hi>Forceps</hi> is in the
Bladder open it, and gently ſearch for the Stone, which when found hold
faſt. You muſt never cloſe your <hi>Forceps</hi> in the Bladder, except
when you have hold of the Stone, for fear of tearing its Membranes. When you
would take hold of the Stone, open the <hi>Forceps</hi> with both Hands, and
you may be aſſured you have hold of it, if its two Bows ſtand wide
open.</p>
                  <p>If the Stone be Oval, and you have hold of it lengthways,
looſe the Stone, and introduce your <hi>Forceps</hi> a ſecond time, and
take hold of it another way. But obſerve here the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Bows
alone is not a ſufficient evidence to aſſure you that you hold the Stone
lengthways, ſince the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance will be, if the Stone be large;
wherefore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more full information of this matter, enquire of the
Patient how long he has been afflicted with this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (for the older
the Stone is, the thicker it grows) or if he feels a great weight in his
Bladder. You may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judge of the thickneſs of the Stone, and perhaps of
its Figure too, by introducing the Finger into the <hi>Anus,</hi> and feeling
it through the Gut. When you have hold of the Stone with your <hi>Forceps,</hi>
do not draw it directly out, but turn your Fiſt to the Right and to the
Left.</p>
                  <p>If the Stone happen to adhere to the Bladder, you muſt 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42110:47"/>not obſtinately reſolve to extract it, leaſt you tear
the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, but if it be fixed to the Neck of the Bladder, it will be freed
without Suppuration. You may conclude that it is fixed to the Bladder; if not,
being very big, it comes forth with Difficulty, and then you muſt proceed
gently in extracting it.</p>
                  <p>If Stones are exceſſively large, as ſome noted in our
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, forbear extracting them, leſt the Patient expire in your Hands. If
you perceive the Stone is broken in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it, put in the <hi>Forceps</hi>
again, and draw out the fragments in the ſame manner as the whole, and bring
out the clotted blood with the Spoon. If the Patient be very weak, remove him
to his Bed, and put a Tent into the Wound to prevent it from cloſing, and
draw out the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fragments after he has recruited his Strength.</p>
                  <p>If the Stone be ſo big that it cannot paſs through the
Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, dilate the Wound.</p>
                  <p>This Operation is called the Greater <hi>Apparatus,</hi> or

Urine more eaſily drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that Sand which is lodged in the Bladder.</p>
                     <p>The Succeſs of the Operation may be gueſſed at from
the quiet repoſe which the Patient enjoys, the Freedom or Breathing, the
Moiſture of the Tongue, no Immoderate Drowth, Pain ſcarce ſenſible,
little or no Feaver, no Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Hypogaſtrick Region, and a
Ceſſation of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation on the fifth or ſixth Day.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a Stone is voided out of the Bladder, and
paſſes into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> where it lodges and obſtructs the
Emiſſion of the Urine. In this caſe if the Stone be near the
<hi>Glans,</hi> preſs that with your Finger, and if it do not eaſily come
forth, bring it out with the Extractor, if both fail, make an Inciſion on the

                     <p>The Stone may ſometimes be drawn out by Suction, this

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and cannot

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42110:48"/>of the Prepuce upwards, and take the Yard between your
fingers to hold the Stone firm, compreſſing it a little, and making the
Inciſion on the Stone lengthways on the ſide of the Yard. When the Stone
lies bare, preſs it out with your forefingers, or pick it out with the
Extractor.</p>
                     <p>THE DRESSING. When the Patient is Cut, Apply a great
Compreſs on the Wound, and let ſome Robuſt Fellow carry him to his Bed.
If there be any fragments of the Stone remaining in the Bladder, or you have
ground to think there are more Stones; put a Tent dipt in ſome Digeſtives
into the Wound to prevent it from cloſing, and if there be a Flux of Blood,
ſtop it with Reſtringents. If there be no Stone or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel remaining in the
Bladder, put no Tent into the Wound, but a Pledget with ſome good Balſam,
with an Emplaſter over that, and a Compreſs both in the form of a
Horſe-ſhooe. The Dreſſing muſt be kept on with a Roller with four
Tails or the double T ſuſpended with a Collar, and the Leggs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the
Knee, bound together with a narrow Roller, to keep the Wound from gaping.</p>
                     <p>The Roller with four Tails is made with a piece of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Cloath three inches broad, and an Ell long; ſlit this lengthways at both ends
to the middle, leaving between four and five inches in the middle undivided.
Apply the plain or entire part on the Wound, and then croſs the two formoſt
Tails, and faſten them to the Collar about the Ribs. (This Collar is a Band
ſtitched at both ends, which is put about the Patients Neck, and hangs down
to his Belly.) Then paſs the two other Tails through the Collar, and bringing
them back faſten them behind.</p>
                     <p>The TT or double T, is a Girth which goes round the Waſt,
with two Straps in the midſt ſown at ſome ſmall diſtance from each
other; apply the middle of the Girth behind, and tie its ends before, then
bring the two Straps between the Leggs, croſſing them on the Wound, and tie
them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Girth or Waſtband.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>THE CURE. We have obſerved before, that in caſe there be
Reaſon to ſuſpect there is Gravel remaining in the Bladder, you muſt
not inſtantly heal the Wound, but put a large Tent into it with ſome good
Digeſtive, to give <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42110:48"/>leave to the Gravel to purge it ſelf
through the Orifice. If the Wound be contus'd, you muſt Suppurate till a
laudable Digeſtion appear, every day leſſening the Tent. But if after the
Operation there be no Contuſion, it ſuffices to put in a Pledgit arm'd with
ſome good Balſam, and Dreſs it twice every day, till it be perfectly
cured. The Patient muſt be fed with good Broths and Gellies, and muſt not
eat any thing Solid for fear of a Feaver, which would obſtruct the Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Wound.</p>
                     <p>To prevent the Stone from being reproduced in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the following Precautions muſt be uſed. The Perſon who is cut muſt lead
a Regular Life; that is, He muſt not eat to Exceſs, for fear of creating
ill Juyces, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach not being capable of good Digeſtion, when it is
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Meat. He muſt eat Wheaten Bread well ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for Rye Bread
containing an Acidity, is apt to Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Humours, and produce the Stone.
He muſt avoid all ſalt Meats, all ſorts of Ragouſts which ordinarily
are high Seaſon'd: All theſe Aliments heat, and are apt to petrefie that
Glairy Matter, which is lodged in the Kidneys and Bladder. Milk Meats, Old
Cheeſe, Hard Eggs, Sallets, Unripe Fruits, create ill Humours, which being
mixed with Acids, acquire a coagulating property. The Uſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Wines and
Beer, is dangerous. <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ſner</hi> has obſerved, that if you put Sand into Stale Beer,
it forms a Stone. Muddy Waters, and Waters of melted Snow and Ice are very
impure, and full of Bodies, which have a Coagulating property. Exceſſive
Application of Mind, Debauches of Wine and Women, all violent Paſſions are
very hurtful to Perſons who have any Diſpoſition to Gravel; all
Exceſſes in any of theſe kinds ſharpen the Blood, and waſt its
Unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Balſamick part. Too long Repoſe is hurtful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the
groſs Feculent Matter ſubſiding, and not being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed by Motion
is collected together, and ſoon coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an Acid.</p>
                     <p>For theſe Reaſons the Patients Diet muſt conſiſt
of ſuch Things as are ſweet and eaſie of Digeſtion, as Veal, Lamb,
Fowl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Broths, in which the Cooling Plants are boyled, as
<hi>Succory, Sorrel, Parſly, Spinage,</hi> or others of the like Nature.</p>
                     <p>White-wine boyled with a Moiety of Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Sleeping and Waking muſt be moderate. The Patient muſt not ſleep on his
Back, for this poſture is Heating. The Body muſt be kept open with
Clyſters, if Nature does not act her part, <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42110:49"/>and gentle

a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Habit of Body, was attacked with a ſuffocative Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh, and a
great Suppreſſion of Urine: A large Aperture was made in the Vein of the
Arm, out of which ſix Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Blood were drawn, together with which came
out 4 ſmall Stones, which made ſo great a noiſe in falling into the
Porringer, as to be heard by the ſtanders by, theſe were of a yellow
Colour, a little inclining to Red, and of the ſame bigneſs with the Gravel
uſually voided in Urine. The Patient was ſoon cured of his Catarrh; but the
Difficulty of Urine remained, and ſoon after he dyed of an Apoplexy.</p>

years of Age, of a Sanguine Complexion, who being near the time of her Delivery
was ſuffocated with a Catarrh. In the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or part of the Liver was found a
great Abſceſs or Maſs of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> ſo
hard and ſtrong, that it could not without great Difficulty be cut with a
good Pair of Sciſſars. This was filled with a Black reddiſh Subſtance,
very Glutinous, not unlike Birdlime. This Glew was ſo Tenacious, it was
difficult to get it off from the Fingers. In the midſt of this was lodged a
Stone, about the bigneſs of a Pullets Egg, which being divided in the
midſt, ſparkled as if it had been filled with Nitre. This Stone was much
harder on the Surface than within, and void of all perceptible Scent.</p>

the Torment which ſhe ſuffered, was waſted to that degree, ſhe ſeemed
a living Skeleton. She had a great <hi>Stupor</hi> on her left Thigh. This
Woman took every day for ſome time, a <hi>Decoction of Speedwell</hi> in

               <p>THIS Operation <hi>is an Inciſion made into the</hi> Anus,
<hi>to lay open an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer in that part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. A Fiſtula is a <hi>Callous, Sinuous, Deep <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
with a ſtreight Mouth or Entry, opening into a more Spacious Bottom.</hi>
Theſe Cavernous Ulcers full of Partitions, are formed by the ſharp and
ſaline parts of the Blood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>immediate</hi> Cauſes of <hi>Fiſtulas</hi> in this
part, are <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Internal.</hi> The <hi>External</hi> are
Contuſions, Impure Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, Falls, Leeches ill applyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
all which obſtruct the Circulation, detain the Humours, and create an
Abſceſs, apt to degenerate and become Fiſtulous. The <hi>Internal</hi>
Cauſes are Abſceſſes proceeding from Obſtructions, Inflammations,
Ulcers, Piles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Anus</hi> is more ſubject to
<hi>Fiſtula's,</hi> than any other part in the whole Body. This proceeds from
the great quantity of Fat, with which the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum</hi> is
loaded, from the Evacuation of the <hi>Faeces</hi> here (this being the common
Sink, where all the Filth of the Body is brought down to be carryed off) from
its continual Humidity, and numerous Veſſels, (as Branches of the
Hypogaſtrick Arteries and Veins, a Branch of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> another of
the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Meſenterick Artery, the Haemorrhoidal Veins, the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Lymphaticks;) and Laſtly, from its Glands which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate a white,
glairy, viſcous Liquor. Some or more of the Cauſes above mentioned, hapning
to meet with a part thus diſpoſed, it is no wonder to find a
<hi>Fiſtula</hi> ſoon formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> differ much, and are to be
diſtinguiſhed by the following Marks.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. If the Fiſtula be in the Fleſhy parts, the
<hi>Pus</hi> is White, Turbid and Viſcous. If in the Nervous parts, the
Patient has Acute and very Senſible Pains, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is Serous and
Sharp. If it attack the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it works through them by its
Acrimony, and the Matter which comes away, reſembles the Waſhings of
Fleſh. If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> emit a thin, clear, ſharp, Humour, it is a
mark it has invaded the Bones, and they are corrupted. In this laſt Caſe
the Calloſity is greater, which proceeds from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Acrimony and
Saline parts, able to Corrode and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riate <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42110:52"/>ſo ſolid a
ſubſtance. How the Saline parts form a Callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, may be conceived by
the like effect which Salt has, when ſtrewed upon Pork which it hardens,
whilſt the Humidity of the Fleſh diſſolving it, its parts like ſo
many ſtakes enter and hinder the Motion. This explication is plauſible
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and may be admitted by thoſe who place the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Bodies in
the Repoſe of their Parts.</p>
               <p>Recent <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> in Perſons of a good Habit of
Body, are curable if the part concern'd will admit the Application of proper
Remedies. But when Inveterate or in ill Bodies, or invading parts neceſſary
to ſupport Life, as the Bladder, Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where no Application
can be made, are deſperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> are of different ſorts; ſome pierce the
Gut without any outward Orifice. Others open outwardly, without entring the
<hi>Inteſtinum Rectum.</hi> Theſe two Species are termed
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat.</hi> Some open within and without the Body, and theſe are
called <hi>Compleat.</hi> There are ſome which have divers Cancers, all
opening into one Cavity.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> pierces the Gut only, there is a
ſmall Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Inflammation Viſible, without the <hi>Pus</hi> flows out
of the Gut, there is Pain, Excoriation, Itching, and a <hi>Teneſmus</hi>
cauſed by the Acrimony of the Matter, which irritates the Part, and
ſollicites the Patient to go to Stool without any neceſſity. If it open
outwardly, the Orifice is diſcerned by the Eye, and the Probe. No
<hi>Pus</hi> comes from the Gut, and none of the preceding Signs appear. The
Sinuoſities and Caverns are found by the Probe, by the Pain and Matter of
various Colour and Condition. From conſidering the Signs, we proceed to</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>The Operation is the ſame, of whatever Nature the
<hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula</hi> be. Place the Patient on the brink of his Bed with his.
Thighs ſtradling; If the Fiſtula open outwardly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Orifice to
introduce the Inciſion-Knife with its Probe. This Knife muſt be crooked and
ſlender, and the Probe Long, Pointed at the end, and made of well temper'd
Metal, to prevent the Danger of its breaking in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Put the
forefinger of the Left Hand up the <hi>Anus,</hi> introduce the Knife into the
External Orifice of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and when you feel the Point of the
Probe on your Finger, perforate the Gut with it, and then draw one end of the
Probe with your Finger, and the other with your Hand, ſo make the Inciſion
quite through at one Slaſh. Obſerve <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42110:52"/>before you uſe
this Inſtrument, to have its Edge cover'd with a fine thin Silver Chape or
Sheath, which keeps it from hurting the Patient when it is thruſt in, and is
to be taken off when the Knife is in the Wound, before the Inciſion be
made.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> pierce the Gut only, and the
Swelling, Pain, Inflammation, or other External Marks of the Bottom of the
<hi>Fiſtula,</hi> are very remote from the <hi>Anus,</hi> forbear the Uſe
of the Knife, which would make the Wound too large and painful, and make the
Aperture with potential Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries only.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe lay an Emplaſter over the Bottom of the
<hi>Fiſtula</hi> of the ſame length with the Orifice deſign'd, apply the
Cauſtick bruiſed on the part, firſt wetting a little the Place, then
cover it with another Emplaſter to keep it on the part. The lower perforated
Emplaſter, prevents the Cauſtick from acting on the adjacent parts, or
ſpreading farther than you deſign. The time of its lying on, muſt be
proportioned to its Strength. After which the Eſcar is to be ſeparated with
the Lancet, and the Operation performed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner above deſcribed.
When the Operation is over, ſearch with your forefinger whether there be any
Sinus's, which if you find, open with the Sciſſors, and cut the
Communications; without which caution the Wound apparently cured, will
infallibly Relapſe. Here you muſt be careful of cutting Arteries which may
lie in the way; in caſe of ſuch accident, ſtop the Blood with
<hi>Lemeries,</hi> Styptick Water, or ſome good Reſtringent Powders, of
which you may find an infinity in Authors.</p>
                  <p>If any Surgeon in the Country ſhall be called to perform
this Operation, unprovided with the Inſtrument deſcribed, he may uſe his
Sciſſors in this manner. Let him take an Iron Wire ſharpned at the end,
and paſs its point through the enlarged Orifice, and thruſt it into the
Gut, having introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Forefinger into the <hi>Anus.</hi> Then let him
draw the point outwards through the <hi>Anus,</hi> and when it is come far
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough out, bring the Ends of the Wire together, and with the left Hand
drawing the Fleſh to him, enter one Blade of the Sciſſors or the crooked
Knife, and at once cut through all the Fleſh. This method is uſeful in
defect of other Conveniences, or in caſe the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> lie ſo deep
in the <hi>Rectum,</hi> you cannot without Difficulty introduce the Knife
together with its Probe. In this Operation, you muſt be careful to avoid
cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sphincter quite through, leaſt the Patient ever after 
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42110:53"/>ſuffer an involuntary emiſſion of the Excrement.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Fill the Wound with Doſſils arm'd with good
Digeſtives, and ſo diſpos'd, that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may have their effects
equally on all its Parts, over theſe lay Pledgits with more Digeſtives, and
after the Cavity is filled, cover all with an Emplaſter, and over this lay a
Triangular Compreſs, which muſt be of this Figure, that one ſide may
paſs between the two Buttocks. The Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings muſt be kept on by the
Roller with four Tails faſtned to the Collar, or with the ſingle or double
T. Theſe are the very ſame with thoſe uſed in the Operation of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the Stone, where the Reader will find them deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, which we ſhall
omit here to avoid unneceſſary Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Good Digeſtives muſt be apply'd twice a day, to
remove all Calloſities. If theſe fail of effecting, lay a Cauſtick on the
Indurations, and when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives is laudable, mundifie the Ulcer after
the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

<hi>Internal</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is an Abſceſs formed in the Duplicature of
the <hi>Pleura</hi> or the Lungs, which coming to break, makes an Effuſion of
Matter on the Diaphragm. The <hi>External</hi> Cauſe is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſome
Fall or the like Accident, which breaking the Veſſels ſpills a great
quantity of Blood, and forms an Abſceſs. Sometimes the Lungs adhere ſo
firmly to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> that the <hi>Pus</hi> do's not load the
Diaphragm, in this Caſe there is no neceſſity to diſengage them, which
can ſcarce be done without Laceration, ſince Life is not immediately
concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe generally proceed from ſome preceding Pleuriſie or
Abſceſs in the Lungs.</p>
               <p>The ſence of Authors about the Cauſes of a Pleuriſie
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer very much; ſome pretend it is cauſed by an Ebullition of the Blood
in the <hi>Pleura,</hi> Some think it is a Bilious Blood lodged in the
Duplicature of that Membrane, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopt in its Courſe, putrefies
and cauſes this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Others derive it from an Effuſion of Blood
out of the Intercoſtal Veſſels, which being lodged in the Interſtices
of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> Suppurates and is converted into <hi>Pus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt common occaſion of Pleuriſies, is the
inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate practice of ſome Perſons, who after violent Heats or
Exerciſe, expoſe themſelves to a ſudden Change, by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquors
cool'd with Ice, going into ſome Cellar or Vault, or other Subterraneous
place, or perhaps opening their Boſom.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42110:54"/>
               <p>While the Body is heated the Pores are open, the Blood is in a
great Agitation, which coming to diſſolve, and the ſorous Part to
ſeparate from the Globular conſequently there follows a profuſe Sweating,
and every Pore is filled with Moiſture, till the Chillneſs of the Ambient
Air, a Draught of Cold Drink, or ſome other External Accident in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtops the Evacuation, and the Matter ready to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, is arreſted
between the Duplicature of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> where it Stagnates, Corrupts,
and by its Acidity, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Blood. Thoſe who indiſcretely keep
their Breaſts open, before the Weather is very warm, are in danger of being
attacked with Pleuriſies, for the ſharp Air ſoon pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Breaſt,
which is a Thin part and not very Fleſhy, creates Obſtructions, and the
Blood meeting with theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, which hinder the free Circulation and
paſſage from the Arteries to the Veins, its Seroſity Tranſudes thro'
the Arterial Coats, and the Blood and <hi>Lympha</hi> together Stagnating in
the <hi>Pleura,</hi> putrefie and form a Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Though Cold be the moſt frequent and general Cauſe of
theſe Diſtempers; yet it is not always ſo, and we often find Men without
overheating their Bodies, or uſing the leaſt violent Exerciſe,
ſurprized with Pleuriſies. In this Caſe I conceive, they ariſe from
ſome Nitrous or Acid Particles conveyed into the Body with the Aliment, or
the Air in Reſpiration, which coagulate the Blood, and intercept its Motion.
This Opinion is confirmed by an Obſervation, That Pleuriſies are very
common after Earthquakes, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings or other Agitations of the Ground, which
throw up the Nitre, and infect the Air, and this doubtleſs is the Cauſe,
why Epidemical Pleuriſies rage ſo much in Hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which more abound
with Nitrous Salts, than colder Climates.</p>
               <p>The ſame Cauſes which produce <hi>Pus</hi> in the
<hi>Pleura,</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe capable of producing an Abſceſs in the
Lungs.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which diſcover Blood or <hi>Pus</hi> lodged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Pleura,</hi> are Inflammation, Acute Pain, or Weight, a ſmall
continual Fever, a Hard, Cloſe, Deep Pulſe, frequent Rigors, a great
Difficulty of Breathing, a Dry Cough, and an univerſal Diſorder of the
Body: The Patient cannot lie on the ſound ſide, (becauſe the Matter
contained in the <hi>Pleura</hi> draws it down,) grows ſuddenly Lean, and
Waſts very much in a little time.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:42110:54"/>
               <p>If the Abſceſs in the <hi>Pleura</hi> break, and the Matter
be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged on the Diaphragm, all theſe Symptoms vaniſh, and the
Patient enjoys ſome eaſe for the preſent; but ſoon after He finds a
difficulty of Breathing, a Weight on the Diaphragm, a Fluctuation, and Great
Diſturbance: The Fever increaſes and becomes burning, the Pulſe riſes,
and the Pain (which is not ſo acute as before) is felt under the ſhort
Ribs: He cannot lie on the ſound ſide, becauſe the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi>
in that poſture is loaded with the <hi>Pus,</hi> which oppreſſes it, and
cauſes great Pain: Sometimes the Spittle becomes Purulent, and
Abſceſſes in the Liver enſue, in the ſame manner as after great
Wounds of the Head. If the <hi>Pus</hi> be lodg'd on both ſides, the Patient
cannot lie on either, but is forced to lie on his Back.</p>
               <p>If there be <hi>Pus</hi> in the Subſtance of the Lungs, the
Patient breaths with great Difficulty, finds a great Weight from the
Compreſſion of the Matter, and a fixt Pain, (which laſt is uſual in
Pleuriſies, as well as in this Caſe; but with this difference, that
Pleuritick pains are ſharp and ſudden, and theſe not ſo vehement, and
come gradually) the Fever is continual without any Remiſſion, and the
Thirſt immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the Spittle purulent, the Patients Mouth and Throat are
dry, his Cheeks of a Florid Red colour, his Eyes ſunk in their Orbit, their
lively Sparkling quite Extinguiſhed, his Nails reflected back, and his whole
Body dry and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated.</p>
               <p>If the Fever encreaſe, and the Patient grows delirous, If his
Spittle is black, livid, or of the colour of dryed Leaves, the Symptoms are
Mortal.</p>
               <p>If the Abſceſs originally proceed from an Internal Cauſe,
the Difficulty of Breathing is not ſo great. The Fever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
accompanyed with frequent Rigors and Cold Sweats, from time to time: At firſt
the Patient ſpits Blood, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a ſpumous Purulent Matter
ſometimes Yellow, (which laſt is a preſage of Death) He is forced to lie
on his Back, by reaſon of the Preſſure of the Matter, if he ſhould lie
on the ſound ſide, and when he turns to lie on it, the Lungs preſs on the
<hi>Pleura,</hi> which unavoidably cauſes Pain: The Eyes ſparkle at the
firſt, but after ſome time loſe their Vivacity, and the Face is
bloated.</p>
               <p>There is no more certain ſign that any Wound pierces the
Breaſt, than the noiſe which the Air makes in ruſhing out, and the Motion
it gives the Flame of a Candle, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to it.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:42110:55"/>
               <p>To ſearch the Wound, the Patient muſt be put in the ſame
poſture he was in at the Time he received it; for the better introducing the
Probe, and giving exit to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If the Wound penetrate the Lungs, the
Blood is Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and the noiſe of the Air is not ſo diſcernible, as in
ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Wounds. The Probe piercing into the Breaſt, and the exit of the Air
are undoubted Signs, there is a penetration of the Breaſt, but not that the
Lungs are wounded, ſince the Air may ruſh out though theſe are entire;
and therefore you muſt enquire for ſomething farther, on which you may
ſafely rely. If a Wound of the Lungs be Superficial, the Patient feels leſs
Pain lying on his Back, than on his Side; but if it be deep, and any of the
Great Veſſels divided, it is the ſame in whatever Poſture he be. If you
introduce your finger into the Wound ſome days after it is made, and find the
Lungs adhere to the <hi>Pleura</hi> round the Wound, it is a ſign there is
extravaſated Blood.</p>
               <p>The Florid Red Colour of the Cheeks in an Abſceſs of the
Lungs, ariſes from ſome parts of the Purulent Matter, which being
abſorbed and mixed with the Blood, accelerate its motion in the numerous
Blood-Veſſels of the Cheeks, which abound with minute Veins and Arteries,
more than moſt other parts. The Vivacity and Sparkling of the Eyes, is
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by the Sharp, Tartarous Salts, which which vitiate the Oleous and
Balſamick part of the Blood; for the Crimſon Tincture of the Maſs,
depends on the due Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its Sulphurous parts; Beſides the Air entring
the Apoſtemated Lungs is corrupted, and cannot impregnate it, as in a State
of Health. The ſinking of the Eyes in their Orbit, proceeds from the general
Emaciation of the Body. The turning back of the Nails happens, becauſe
theſe being Productions of the Skin, and this only ſupplyed with a Serous
Liquor deſtitute of Spirits, it decays, dries, ſhrinks, and by
conſequence draws them back with it.</p>
               <p>If theſe Signs proceed from a Wound not penetrating the
Breaſt, they ceaſe in few Days upon Bleeding, and a good Digeſtion; but
if the Lungs are corrupted, they continue and increaſe, and the ſame
happens if the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> be loaded by any Extravaſated Matter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Flatus</hi> is no certain ſign that the Wound
penetrates the Breaſt, and happens ſometimes in Wounds of other Parts.</p>
               <p>Be not too haſty to proceed to the Operation, if the
Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion be not very troubleſome.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When it is evident there is <hi>Pus</hi> lodged in the Cavity
of the Breaſt, an Inciſion muſt be made for evacuating it; but it would
be a very great Raſhneſs to attempt this, without firſt conſidering
there are ſeveral Caſes in which it may be uſeleſs. If the Abſceſs
be in the ſubſtance of the Lungs, no Aperture of the Breaſt can avail any
thing towards the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the Matter; on the contrary, if the
Abſceſs be on the Surface of the Lungs, and preciſely in the place of
their Adhaeſion to the <hi>Pleura</hi> (which may be diſcovered by a
conſtant and fixed Pain) there the Operation is abſolutely
neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>If a Wound be made by a Thruſt, and happen to be low enough,
or otherwiſe convenient for the diſcharging the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any farther, the
Inciſion will be needleſs; ſince the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated Blood may be
evacuated through this Orifice, by placing the Patient in a proper Poſture,
and dilating the Wound if neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The place of perforating the Breaſt, is ſometimes in the
Artiſts Choice, and ſometimes directed by Neceſſity. The <hi>Place of
Neceſſity</hi> is where the Matter preſents it ſelf; as in
Abſceſſes of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> or an Adheſion of the Lungs to it.
The <hi>Place of Choice,</hi> is that which the Operator likes beſt, when no
Circumſtances determine him more to one part, than another: Here the moſt
proper Place is, between the third and fourth of the Baſtard Ribs, beginning
to count from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upwards, about four fingers breadth below the point of the
<hi>Scapula,</hi> and about the ſame diſtance from the Spine of the
Back.</p>
                  <p>Before the Operation, enquire if the Patient do not feel Pain
in ſome part of the Breaſt; if he has not been for ſome time paſt
ſubject to Diſtempers of that Part, has not had a Pleuriſie, or the like;
for in theſe Caſes the Diaphragm often adheres as high as the third or
fourth Ribs, and to make a Perforation lower, would be to no effect.</p>
                  <p>For making the Operation; let the Patient ſit on his Bed,
and Aſſiſtants be planted by to keep his Body firm; begin to count the
Ribs from below upward, and when you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſecond and third of the
Baſtard Ribs, pinch up the Skin tranſverſely, and let one of the
Aſſiſtants hold one end of the Folded Skin, and your ſelf the other
with your left Hand; Then make your Inciſion about two Inches large on the
Fold from above downwards, that is lengthways of the Body. Then cut the
<hi>Latiſſimus Dorſi</hi> tranſverſely, for by any other 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42110:56"/>way of Section, the Fibres of this Muſcle cloſing,
would ſtop the Orifice of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and hinder the evacuation of
the Matter. Then continue to cut through the Intercoſtal Muſcles. When you
are come to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> cut through it with your Knife, guiding the
Point with your Finger, leſt it enter too far, and wound the Lungs or
Diaphragm, which ſometimes adhere to that Membrane. After the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made,
introduce your Finger to enlarge the Inciſion of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and
free the adhering Lungs, if no <hi>Pus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for if <hi>Pus</hi> come
out freely, it is a ſign, as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this adheſion is
Natural.</p>
                  <p>For the forcing out the <hi>Pus,</hi> oblige the Patient to
lie down, and cloſe his Mouth and Noſtrils. If the Lungs fill up the
Orifice, and endeavour to get out; you muſt thruſt them back with a Blunt
Hollow Probe with a Hole at each end, for the Matter to paſs through, or a
Pipe adapted to the largeneſs of the Wound. If Flatuoſities happen, long
Pipes are very proper, becauſe the Orifice of the Wound is ſo ſmall and
deep, it would be difficult without theſe, to give vent to the impriſon'd
Air. If you ſhould make uſe of the Probe to diſcover whether you have
paſt through the <hi>Pleura,</hi> you may happen to ſeparate it from the
Ribs, and make another Vacuity, in which the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing collected will create
a new Abſceſs, wherefore it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to forbear this Tryal. If it be
blood which comes from the Wound, you may let out a greater quantity, than if
it be <hi>Pus,</hi> the latter containing, according to common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, more
Spirits, and the Patient ſooner falling into a <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope.</hi> Obſerve
in dividing the Intercoſtal Muſcles, to make your Inciſion in the midſt
between the Ribs, to prevent lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bones bare, which would leave behind
it a Fiſtulous Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. You muſt begin here with putting in a Tent of
Lint flat at the end, which enters the Wound, and Cupped or Headed at the
other; This muſt be as little as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, leaſt it offend the Lungs,
and muſt be very ſoft leaſt it hurt the Ribs, and lay the Bone bare,
which may cauſe an incurable <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> You muſt not forget to
paſs a double Thread through the Tent, which may be faſtned round the Body,
if you pleaſe to hinder it from getting into the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Breaſt.
Next fill the Wound with Doſſils arm'd with ſome good Digeſtives, lay
on a Pledgit, then an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter, and over all a Compreſs dipt in ſome
good Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative to prevent any Fluxion on the Part. The beſt
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſatives are the <hi>Styptick Waters,</hi> or in defect of theſe
<hi>Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate</hi> 
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:42110:56"/>well heated. Theſe muſt be kept on
with the Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin. For this purpoſe fold your Napkin lengthways into three
Plaits, Roll it at both ends, then apply its Middle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wound, and
beginning here, bring it round the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pinning it at its Ends. The Napkin
muſt be ſuſpended by the Scapular. The Way of making it is thus: Take a
piece of Linen near ſix Inches broad, and long enough to reach from the
Napkin before, to the ſame behind; then cut a Hole in the midſt lengthways,
large enough for the Patient to thruſt his Head through, then draw it down on
the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Pin one End to the Napkin before, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behind.
Some chuſe to faſten the two ends of the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular between the Pleats of
the Napkin; Some likewiſe cut the ends of the Napkin ſix Inches or more
lengthwiſe, and croſs the cut Ends or Tails over one another.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Patient muſt be kept lying on his Back, with
his Head raiſed, and his Body half erect; he muſt be left undiſturb'd
till he finds a new Matter, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the taking off the Dreſſings to
give it vent. If the Lungs preſent themſelves and fill the Orifice, put
them gently back with the long Pipe, ſo let the <hi>Pus</hi> diſcharge it
ſelf through its Cavity, and after the Evacuation, proceed to the Uſe of
good Detergents.</p>
                  <p>Blood comes away ordinarily the firſt three or four Days,
next a Water for ſome Days more, and after this <hi>Pus</hi> which by degrees
thickens. If this be thick to exceſs, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated with Difficulty, and the
Patient ſenſible there is ſome ſtill remaining, Syringe the Wound with
Vulnerary Inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made of the Decoctions of the <hi>Birthworts,
&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Aloes, Myrrh, Frankincenſe,</hi> or any other proper
Ingredients; correct the Intemperature of the Air with Fire brought to the
Patients Bed-ſide, during the time of Dreſſing him, and keep the Wound no
longer open than is neceſſary, becauſe the Air by its Acidity is apt to
condenſe and coagulate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated Matter, and hinder its Evacuation.
If the <hi>Pus</hi> be thick, or there happen to be a Mixture of Water, a
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Barley ſtrained with a little Honey of Roſes</hi> is very
good. If the Injections do not come away freely, make way for them with your
Finger or the Pipe, or if the Lungs adhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> free them by introducing your
Finger and turning it round. If the Blood be too Watry, and the Patient load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with too great a quantity of Matter, take off the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings three or four
times a Day. There is a Flux of Matter very often, which laſts for three or
four Months; when you <pb n="84" facs="tcp:42110:57"/>obſerve nothing but <hi>Pus</hi>
come from the Wound, you may Heal and Cicatrize it. When the Air acts on the
Blood extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Breaſt, it is very often Coagulated without
being converted into <hi>Pus,</hi> and comes away in Clots. If the Lungs are
wounded forbear Injections at firſt, at leaſt leave out <hi>Aloes,</hi>
becauſe the Patient will be apt to bring them up thro' the Mouth. But after
this is conſolidated, inject with <hi>Tincture of Aloes, Wine</hi> or
<hi>Vulnerary Decoctions, with Honey of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> if the <hi>Pus</hi> be
ſmall in Quantity. After a Thruſt with a Sword, if Blood come plentifully
out, and in a day or two after none appear, you muſt endeavour to cloſe the
Wound, the ſmall Veſſels only in all appearance being Hurt, which by
degrees are Healed by the Glutinous Parts of the Maſs. If the Wounds
penetrate on both ſides, or other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions require an Aperture, you
muſt not leave both Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices open at once, leaſt the Air entring on both
ſides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Lungs, and Suffocate the Patient. In ſhort, all
Wounds of the Breaſt are dangerous, Death is commonly the end, or if they
happen to be cured, ſome <hi>Phthiſis</hi> or ſome lingring Diſtemper
follows. Wounds of the Breaſt have ſometimes been fortunate to Perſons
labouring under <hi>Aſthma's,</hi> or other Chronical Infirmities by opening
a Way for applying Medicines to the Diſeaſed Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Empyema's</hi> being uſually Conſequent on

affected, and Scarifying deep, from theſe Inciſions iſſued out a Sanies

the Hiſtory of a Pleuriſie in a Perſon of 30 years of Age. In the firſt

him in the Arm. To the ſide affected, he uſed Anodyne <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42110:58"/>Fomentations, and Internally Pectoral Medicines, with all other things
uſual on the like occaſions. Upon the Fourth Day the Pain in his ſide
ceaſed, and his expectoration was eaſie. The Seventh Day a great ſweat
aroſe, and the Patient Recovered; But on the Tenth he was ſeized with a
violent Fever, and Shaking, and dyed the thirteenth. <hi>Hildanus</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Extirpation of the
<hi>Cancer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Operation is <hi>a Total Extirpation of that Raging
Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to free the Patient from all its miſchievous
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of this cruel Diſeaſe is a ſharp corroſive
Blood or Lympha, which diſcharging it ſelf on ſome part, corrodes and
tumefies it. If it invades the glandulous parts, it probably ariſes from a
virulent <hi>Lympha</hi> becoming Corroſive, not unlike <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi>
If the Muſcular or Fleſhy Parts, it may be derived from the ſame ill
qualities in the Blood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cancer</hi> then is <hi>a Round, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nequal, Livid,
Painful Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, formed by ſome Sharp and Corroſive Humours.</hi> In a
<hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> the Tumefied Veins creep along the Surface of the Skin,
reſembling the Claws of a Crab, from which appearance it derives its Name.
The roundneſs proceeds from the Figure of the Glands, in which this
Diſtemper is Seated, for the Flux of Humours diſtending them equally, they
preſerve their Natural Figure. The Pain is more vehement in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
of the Glandulous Parts than others, becauſe theſe are furniſhed with an
infinity of Nervous <hi>Fibrillae,</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all Men to be the
immediate Organ of Senſation. The <hi>Lympha</hi> contributes much to their
encreaſe, the Glands being the Receptacles of that Liquor. When the moſt
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive parts of the Blood eſcape out of the Veſſels, an Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
enſues, and the ſlow progreſs of this, proceeds from the difficulty which
the parts of the Blood find in making their way by the ſlowneſs of the
Circulation.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Cancers</hi> are <hi>Internal,</hi> others
<hi>External,</hi> ſome <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> others not.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:42110:59"/>
               <p>THE SIGNS. A Cancer often in its beginning, is not larger than a
Pea, and grows at ſome times faſter, at others ſlower. At firſt it
appears like a Little, Hard, Blackiſh Swelling, Troubleſome by its
exceſſive itching. This Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour after ſome time encreaſing, appears
Hard, of a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Colour and Livid. The Pain at firſt is Tolerable, but
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes Violent, and when the Ulceration is compleated ſtrikes to the
quick, and emits an intolerable ſtench. In its Progreſs when it is upon the
point of Ulcerating, there is an Exceſſive Heat, with Pulſation and
Pricking: The Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Veins are Swoln, filled with a black Blood, and
creep along the Skin, reſembling the Claws of a Crab. Cancers ſeldom come
of themſelves, but moſt commonly proceed from Schirrous or Scrophuious
Tumours ill Cured. The Principal Seat of Cancers is in the Glandulous parts,
eſpecially the Breaſts of Women, and ſometimes the Mouth, Noſe, Lips,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſtrange aptneſs to degenerate, makes all Ulcers of
theſe parts juſtly to be feared.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Cancer</hi> not Ulcerated is called Occult, and Apparent
if it be Ulcerated. The Signs which diſcover a <hi>Cancer</hi> is
Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating, are Acceſſion of Pain, Pulſation, and unuſual prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and an increaſe of the Heat and Swelling.</p>
               <p>Occult <hi>Cancers</hi> are beſt left untoucht, for fear of
irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, and haſtning the Patients End. <hi>Cancers</hi> in the
Breaſts and Glandulous Parts are very dangerous; becauſe theſe parts are
very ſenſible, and more ſuſceptible of ill impreſſions than others.
This ariſes from the abundance of <hi>Lympha</hi> in them, which growing
ſour, do's more miſchief than in parts where it is leſs plentiful.
External <hi>Cancers</hi> are very difficultly medled with, Medicines being
more apt to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, than heal them.</p>
               <p>Before Operation, try if they are curable by General Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
as obſerving a Good D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mild, Repeated Purging and Bleeding. The Haemorrhoidal Flux in Men, or the
<hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua</hi> in Women, afford great Relief in this Diſeaſe: Sharp
Medicines prepoſterouſly uſed, make the Diſeaſe incurable. The Cure
of a <hi>Cancer</hi> not Ulcerated, muſt be attempted by Mild and Gentle
Remedies; which cool, allay, diſſolve, and repel the Matter kindly, without
raiſing any Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſuch are <hi>Mulberry, Plantane</hi> and
<hi>Strawberry Waters.</hi> If theſe prove ineffectual, then proceed to
Operation.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When you firſt perceive in the Breaſt a Small, Hard,
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent <pb n="89" facs="tcp:42110:59"/>Tumour in the Glandulous Parts, with other
Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a growing <hi>Cancer,</hi> extirpate it. Place the Patient in a
convenient Poſture, to lay open the Tumefied Gland, then free and take it
off. If any Veſſels appear, which may give occaſion to fear a
Haemorrhage, tie theſe before you cut out the Tumour.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the <hi>Cancer</hi> extend over the whole Breaſt, yet
if it be moveable without adheſion to the Ribs or <hi>Sternum,</hi> there is
room to hope the Operation may be ſucceſsful, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the Patient
be young, and have as good Habit of Body.</p>
                  <p>To perform the Operation in this Caſe: The Patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
placed on his Back in his Bed, lift up the Arm on the ſame ſide the
<hi>Cancer,</hi> and draw it back; then embrace the whole Breaſt with Pincers
made of two half Creſcents, which may paſs over each other when the Pincers
are ſhut. The Breaſt being in this manner held faſt, cut all off with a
crooked Knife very ſharp and flat, beginning beneath, that the Mammary
Veſſels may be divided laſt of all, for fear of a Flux of Blood. Take the
whole Tumour off as quick as may be, cloſe to the Ribs. This is the manner of
performing the Operation, when the <hi>Cancer</hi> is Ulcerated.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Cancer</hi> be not Ulcerated, make a Crucial
Inciſion through the Skin, without entring the Glandulous Body; then
ſeparate the four Flaps, and embrace the Carnous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with the Pincers
above deſcribed, and take it off with a ſharp Knife. If you are not
provided with Pincers of this kind, Gripe the Tumour as well as you can in your
Hand, or if you cannot conveniently do this, uſe a ſort of a Steel Fork to
hold it, and ſo cut it off.</p>
                  <p>The Operation but a little while ſince, was commonly
performed in the following manner, but it is too cruel. The Patient was laid on
his Back on his Bed, The Surgeon rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Arm on the ſame ſide with
the <hi>Cancer,</hi> drawing it back to lay the Breaſt fairly open; then he
paſſed a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with a very ſtrong Thread through the Baſis of the
Breaſt, and another after the ſame manner to croſs with the former. Next
he tyed the four Ends of the Thread toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made a Knot, with which he
drew the whole Breaſt up, and then cut all off as near the Ribs as
poſſible, with a very ſharp Knife. He began to cut in the lower part of
the Breaſt, ending at the Veſſels next the <hi>Axillae,</hi> and leaving
a ſmall Portion of Skin to cover the Veſſels, for the more eaſie
ſtopping the Flux of Blood. This way of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating <pb n="90" facs="tcp:42110:60"/>would
ſtill be good, if we had not a more convenient way of apprehending the
Breaſt, after the manner above deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Gently compreſs the ſides of the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
Breaſt, to ſqueeze out the Blood and Humours, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs over the
Wound an Actual Cautery to diſperſe the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and laſtly apply the
Vitriol Button to ſtop the Flux of Blood: Take Vitriol groſly powder'd,
wrap this in Tow, make it up round like a Button, and apply it to the
Veſſels; lay over this Pledgits with a Reſtringent Powder, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them with a large Emplaſter with a Compreſs over, and keep all on with the
Napkin and Scapular, deſcribed in the <hi>Gaſtroraphia</hi> and
<hi>Paracenteſis</hi> of the Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The following Bandage which retains the Name of
<hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſician who firſt invented it, is
very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. Take a Linen Girth three inches broad, and of a competent
length to go round the Body; ſow two Straps in the middle of this, about two
inches or more diſtant from each other, and long enough to reach ſo as to
be faſtned behind, apply the middle of the Girth on the Breaſt, and
paſſing it round the Body; bring its ends as far back on the firſt Round
as they will extend, and pin them there; then take up the two Straps, croſs
them, paſs one over the Right, the other over the Left Shoulder, and faſten
them behind to the Girth.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Apply Suppuratives to procure a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
to draw out the Corroſive Matter remaining in the Part, and hinder the
<hi>Cancer</hi> from making farther Devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then Deterge well, and
Cicatrize the Wound.</p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Subject; It is neceſſary to let the
Reader know, ſome Authors have pretended to Cure Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated <hi>Cancers</hi>
by the uſe of Medicines only, without Manual Operation. Some aſſure us,
this has been effected by the Application of red Snails, taken out of their
Shells: Theſe, they tell us, leave a ſlime on the Part, their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are
corroded, they ſwell to a vaſt ſize, and at length burſt. If this
Method fail of the intended Succeſs, it has this advantage, that it may be
tryed with little Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riverius Obſ.</hi> 20. tells us, a young Surgeon, a
Stranger, cured a <hi>Cancer</hi> beginning to Ulcerate in a Woman of 50 years

Vinegar; then Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42110:60"/>all over, till the remaining
Matter obtain the conſiſtence of a Paſt.</hi> He bathed well the
ſuffering Part with Rags ſoaked in Wine well warmed, rubbing it a little
roughly to enrage it. Then he ſpread a little of his Compoſition on a
Pledgit, ſix times leſs than the Tumour, applying this on the Part, and
leaving it on for the ſpace of 24 Hours, in which time it made an Eſcar
about ſix times as large as the Pledgit, and equal to the Tumour; after the
Separation of which, he incarned and cicatrized the Wound. If any part of the
Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour remain'd, he conſumed it with <hi>Burnt Alum</hi> and
<hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate,</hi> uſing only dry Lint for the Incarning it. The moſt
obſervable Accidents in this Proceſs of Curing, were upon the Application
of the Medicine; the Fever immediately grew higher, a Vomiting, Flux and
Copious Urining enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which Symptoms laſted for two or three Days.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author aſſures us, He had cured a
<hi>Cancer</hi> of 13 years ſtanding, with very painful Carnoſities in an
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Woman, with ſo innocent a Medicine as <hi>Night-ſhade,
Plantain</hi> and <hi>Roſe-water,</hi> with the addition of <hi>Honey of

in the Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> uſes the following Method; A
certain Woman he tells us, had an Occult <hi>Cancer</hi> in her Breaſt,
proceeding from Coagulated Milk. She having abundance of Milk, and happening to
fall into a Suppreſſion of Urine, an Inflammation enſued, which curdled
it. After the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation was gone, there remained a Tubercle or ſmall
Lump, about the bigneſs of a Bean; which being neglected, continued for the
ſpace of 40 Years without any Pain, but the Woman growing Old and Decrepit,
the Tumour began to encreaſe, grow Painful, and extend quite to and under the
Arm-pit. Having procured her ſelf to be bled in the Arm, on the ſame ſide
with this <hi>Cancerous</hi> Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhe was deprived of the uſe of it.
Our Author at the entreaty of this miſerable Woman, undertook a Pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Cure. This he began with preſcribing her an exact Order of Living, then
purging her with the following Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. ℞ <hi>Leaves of Sena,</hi>
℥iſs. <hi>Dodder, Fumitory, Scabious, Harts-Tongue, of each</hi>

Pain increaſing, the Tumour broke, and a ſanious Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Matter iſſued
out, reſembling Water after the waſhing of Fleſh. This Tumour at length
became Painful, Stinking and Ulcerated, in ſo malignant a manner, that it
corroded the Breaſt to the Ribs, and up to the Arm-pit. The Patient ſelt

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Operation of the
<hi>Bronchotomia.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>an opening of the</hi> Aſpera Arteria,
<hi>to give the Air liberty of entring the Lungs in Tumours of the
Throat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSES. Theſe Tumours ſometimes are occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by
external Hurts, ſtraining of the Voice, and long or much talking; ſometimes
the Humours are ſoured by vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Paſſion, and create an Inflammation
of the <hi>Larynx.</hi> This Inflammation oppoſes the free Circulation of the
Blood, and the Blood endeavouring to force a paſſage, encreaſes the
Tenſion; and the part encreaſing in its Dimenſions, preſſe the
<hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> and hinders the paſſage of the Air, and hence
ſuffocation enſues.</p>
               <p>The immediate Cauſe of Quinſies is Sharp, Vitiated, Lympha,
which Corrodes, Inflames and Obſtructs the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, Glands or Muſcles of
the Throat. The Remote or Occaſional cauſes, are thoſe before mentioned,
or ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſharp or ſour Aliment, ſome Preternatural
Subſtance ſwallowed by neglect, which being lodged in the Throat, by its
Compreſſion, may cauſe Pain and Fluxion: Or laſtly, Mercurial
Inunctions; which raiſing a Salivation by the Sharpneſs and Cauſtick
quality of the <hi>Serum,</hi> is very apt to inflame their Parts. There are
two ſorts of Quinſies, the <hi>Genuine</hi> and the <hi>Spurious;</hi> The
<hi>Genuine</hi> is <hi>attended with a Fever, and Difficulty of
Breathing,</hi> the Spurious or Baſtard is <hi>a ſimple Inflammation of the
Throat, without any other ill Accident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which diſcover a Quinſie, is Breeding, are
Difficulty of Swallowing, and Breathing, a Pain in the <hi>Gula,</hi> a great
Heat and Burning in the Throat, a pain in ſtirring the Neck, a thick and
glutinous Spit, and a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Head-ach. When the Quinſie is come to
Perfection, the Patient finds a great difficulty in Breathing and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
Drinks, and all Liquid Aliments revert by the Noſe, the Tongue is flabby and
ſoft, the <hi>Fauces</hi> are full of <hi>Saliva,</hi> Reſpiration is
intercepted, and the Patient cannot lie down without danger of Suffocation.
When the Quinſie is very great, the Tongue livid and loaded with a thick,
ſaline, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh <pb n="94" facs="tcp:42110:62"/>Matter, the Face is ſwoln and
inflamed, its Veins are Tumid, the Fever very acute, with an intolerable
Thirſt, and a bitter Taſt in the Mouth; the Eyes ſtick out, and the
Pulſe is wavering and ſmall.</p>
               <p>Children are more ſubject to Diſtempers of this kind, than
grown Perſons, their Throat being more clogged with Pituitous ſtuff. When
they are attacked with this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, their Countenance is pale, they
complain of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pain in the Neck, Hawk very much, and what they bring
up, is thick and glutinous.</p>
               <p>A Quinſie after a Fever, without any preceding Tumour in the
Throat, is very dangerous; and the ſame Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick holds in all pain and
difficulty of Breathing, without any apparent ſwelling in the Neck. If the
Lungs are Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a Quinſie, the Patient moſt commonly dies upon the
ſeventh Day, or if they exceed that, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> aſſures us an
<hi>Empyema</hi> will certainly follow. The Diſtemper by its ſharp Nature
cauſing a Peripneumony, which terminates in a Suppuration. Some Authors
however deny any Quinſie ever to have had ſuch a <hi>Criſis.</hi> If the
Fever does not abate, it is an ill ſign, and if the Patient foams at Mouth,
Death is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near. If the internal Inflammation be communicated to the
external Parts, and a ſwelling ariſes with a redneſs on the Breaſt, it
is a very good ſign.</p>
               <p>In a Quinſie, the Patient ſometimes can ſwallow Solids
only, and not Liquids, and ſometimes Liquids, and not So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids. When the
Inflammation is ſeated on the Palate, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula,</hi> and Neighbouring
parts, he cannot ſwallow Solids, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the pain they cauſe, and
theſe parts are diſabled from thruſting them down the <hi>Gula;</hi> but
Liquids make their way by their own weight. If the Inflammation be only on the
Muſcles of the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> he ſwallows Solids more eaſily than
Liquids; becauſe the Inflammation contracting the <hi>Oeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus.</hi> The
Liquid Aliment being protruded by the Tongue, and finding no paſſage by
their Fluidity, fly up on every ſide, and revert by the Noſe.</p>
               <p>Tumours in the Throat muſt not be neglected, becauſe the
<hi>Lympha</hi> ſtagnating there in the Veſſels and Glands, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt
to breed a Quinſie by its ſharpneſs. This Diſtemper is not ſo
dangerous in growing Children, as in Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it ordinarily proceeding
in theſe from the Redundance of a Nutritious Juice, void of all Acrimony, but
in Adults it is cauſed by an Acid, Vitious <hi>Lympha.</hi> If the Remedies
preſcribed in this Diſtemper prove ineffectual, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42110:62"/>be in danger of Suffocation, you muſt proceed to the
Operation.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>This is not to be undertaken raſhly, and therefore firſt
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whence the difficulty of Breathing proceeds, which if caus'd by an
Inflammation of the Lungs, will fruſtrate your Hopes. It may happen the whole
length of the <hi>Aſpera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi> may be inflamed, and filled with a
thick <hi>Lympha,</hi> in which caſe it is beſt to forbear making any
Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>When you intend to perform the Operation, place the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
in a Chair, or on his Bed, and plant a Servant behind to hold his Head,
reſting on his Breaſt, being careful not to draw it too much back, leaſt
he intercept the little Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remaining, and ſuffocate him before
you can finiſh your Work. The moſt commodious and ſecure place to make
the Aperture in, is about an inch below the Top of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx,</hi>
between the third and fourth Ring of the <hi>Aſpera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria.</hi> But in
great Inflammations where the Muſcles are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much Tumefied, and it is
difficult to count the Rings, you may make your Operation in the middle of the
Windpipe. To make the Aperture, pinch the Skin up tranſverſly if
poſſible, and make a Longitudinal Inciſion; then ſeparate with the
point of your Inciſion Knife, as finely as poſſible the Bronchial
Muſcles, and the <hi>Sternohyoidaei,</hi> in doing which the Line which
ſeparates them, will ſerve to guide you. When you have laid the
<hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> bare with a Lancet, divide the carnous Membrane which
unites the Cartilaginous Rings, having an eſpecial care not to cut the
Recurrent Nerves, which inevitably deſtroys the Voice, theſe Nerves
furniſhing Spirits to the Muſcles of the Tongue. Avoid hurting the
<hi>Glandulae Thyroidaeae,</hi> which are Receptacles of the <hi>Lympha,</hi>
the effuſion of which; would make an inundation in the Wound, the Air being
apt to corrupt the Cartilages.</p>
                  <p>The Lancet muſt be kept in a ſtreight Line with the
Scales, by a Tape wrapt round to its Point; before you take out the Lancet,
introduce a Probe into the Orifice, and on this ſide a ſhort, flat
<hi>Cannula</hi> or Pipe, a little crooked at the end. This muſt not be
thruſt too far, for fear of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hinder part of the <hi>Aſpera
Arteria,</hi> and cauſing a Cough. The Pipe muſt have two Rings to paſs
Ribbons thro', which are to be ty'd about the Neck, but not too ſtrait, for
fear of choaking the Patient; leave the Pipe in the <pb n="96" facs="tcp:42110:63"/>Wound
till the Inflammation be over. You muſt not apply any Tow to the end of the
Pipe, becauſe the Inciſion is made for the free paſſage of the Air;
beſides there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſome part of it may be ſucked through the Pipe,
and ſuffocate the Patient. To take off the chillneſs of the Air, before it
enters the Lungs, keep a good Fire conſtantly in the Chamber, or if the Party
be not in a condition to bear this Expence, bring a Chaſingdiſh of Coals to
his Bed, and draw the Curtains. When you perceive the Air recovers its Natural
paſſage by the Mouth, then take out the Pipe and dreſs the Wound.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Bring the Lips of the Wound even together, which
is eaſily done with a ſmall Fillet, lay on the Wound a Pledgit arm'd with
ſome good Balſam. The beſt Application to ſimple Wounds not contus'd
which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a prompt Reunion, is a Pledgit dipt in ſome Styp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Water.
This is the celebrated Balſam which Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks make ſo great a ſtir
about, that with which they cure ſo ſpeedily the Cuts they ſometimes make
upon the Stage, to give the gazing Multitude a proof of their rare Skill.</p>
                  <p>After the Lips of the Wound are brought together, keep them
cloſe with the uniting Bandage. To make this, take a Fillet about two inches
and a half broad, and an Ell long, ſlit a Hole in the midſt of it
lengthways, more than two inches long, rub it at both ends, and paſs one end
or head through the Hole in the midſt, put the Fillet about the Neck, apply
the ſlit on the Wound, and draw the two ends or heads to keep the Lips of the
Wound together, being careful not to ſtraiten it too much; for fear of
inflaming the ſuffering part; Then bring the ends of the Fillet behind, and
continue to make as many rounds about the part, as the length of the Fillet
will admit of, pinning it where it ends.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Patient muſt be fed with good Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Liquids; for all ſolids in Deglution, are apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Aſpera
Arteria,</hi> and put it into ſome Motion, which obſtructs the Reunion. If
you perceive the Wound is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Suppurate, rake off the Dreſſings,
and put a little Balſam under the ordinary Bandage; but if no ſigns of
Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration appear, let the Dreſſing remain untoucht, till the Coalition
be perfected. For ſimple Wounds, often when no Styptick Water is applyed, are
cured without Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:42110:63"/>
                  <p>When Quinſies are curable without Manual Operation, the
Method of Treating them is as follows. The Patient muſt be confined to a
Regular Diet; for Abſtemiouſneſs and ſpare feeding, are uſeful in all
Inflammations whatever. We may account theſe in effect a perpetual Bleeding,
ſince the Blood not being ſupplyed in proportion to its expence in
Tranſpiration, muſt needs waſt. His Chamber muſt be kept moderately
warm; both extremes of Heat and Cold being equally miſchievous: An Exceſs
in the firſt putting the Blood into a violent Agitation, neceſſarily
heightens the Inflammation; on the other hand an Exceſs in the latter,
produces the ſame effect by obſtructing the Circulation, and hindering the
Reflux of the Blood in the Veins. I Aſſign the Arteries as the Channels
which convey the Matter of obſtructions, becauſe theſe diſcharge into
the parts the Blood forced through them with great impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the
contraction of the Heart, the Veins being wholly calm, and without Pulſation.
The moſt commodious Poſture of Body is erect; becauſe when it is bended,
the Veſſels are preſt together, the Circulation is leſs free, and the
Air do's not ſo eaſily enter the Branches of the <hi>Trachea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Patient cannot ſwallow Liquids, let him remain for
ſome time without Aliment, rather than do any Violence to the ſuffering
part. The leſs he eats, the more ſpeedy his Cure will be; Men may
ſubſiſt for ſeveral Days without Food, eſpecially in Acute
Diſtempers. The Want of ſleep, which is a Symptom frequently attending
Quinſies, is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, continual Waking, being apt to inflame the
Blood. To remedy this, endeavour to procure ſleep by Somniferous Emulſions
made with the four <hi>cold Seeds,</hi> and <hi>white Poppy Seed in Elder
Water:</hi> Let a Glaſs of this be taken going to Reſt, keeping the Mind
Serene, and free from all diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Paſſions. In danger of a
Suffocation, bleed the Patient inſtantly in the Jugular Veins; nothing can
diſcharge the Superior parts more immediately or effectually, than an
Aperture of theſe Veſſels; but here obſerve not to hazard ſtrangling
him with a Ligature about the Neck, which ſome indiſcreetly make. To
prevent this, compreſs the Neck on the ſide and behind with a Fillet,
without paſſing over the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> this Ligature is
ſufficient to tumifie the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. If for any Reaſon the Patient
cannot endure Bleeding, apply Cupping Glaſſes to the Thighs, to determine
the Blood to the inferior parts.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42110:64"/>
                  <p>Clyſters are to be frequently given; Theſe may be made

               <p>BLeeding is <hi>the dextrous opening a Vein or Artery, to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a certain quantity of Blood,</hi> in order to preſerve Health, cure
ſome Diſtemper, or at leaſt give Relief to the Patient.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Bleeding is commonly required in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
Continual, Malignant and Spotted Fevers. In vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pains, Apoplexies,
Quinſies, Inflammation of the Lungs, Pleuriſies, <hi>Aſthma's,</hi> and
all Diſeaſes ariſing from Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or attended with Sanguineous
Eruptions on the Skin, as the Meazles, Small Pox, all Ebullitions of the Blood,
Boils, Carbuncles and <hi>Eryſipelas</hi>'s. It is very ſerviceable in
Women with Child, to prevent Flooding and Abortion, and in their Labour to
facilitate and advance the Birth. It conduces very much to the ſpeedy Cure of
Abſceſſes, Wounds, Ulcers, Fractures and Diſlocations, to divert all
Defluxions on the Wounded Part, and prevent all ill Accidents, which
ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily attend theſe caſes. Bleeding is likewiſe very much uſed in
difficulty of Breathing, and all Repletion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Before this Operation be preſcribed or performed, all
Circumſtances ought to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nature of the
Diſtemper, the Patients Strength, Age, Complexion and Sex, the Seaſon,
Climate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great Diſeaſes require large Evacuations, milder yield to
leſs. As for Age, bleeding is convenient at all times, if the Diſeaſe be
preſſing. <hi>M. Patin</hi> bled a Child within three days after it was
born, who lived after to a very great Age. If neceſſity require, fer not to
bleed Ancient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they not being exempted from a Multitude of
Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whoſe progreſs cannot be checked by any other way: But in
Perſons between fifteen and ſixty years of Age, you may bleed boldly,
having nothing to fear. Much greater heed is to be taken to the Patients
Strength, than his Age; for if his Strength be quite ſpent, though his
Diſtemper ſeem to plead very much for bleeding, you muſt forbear,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this Caſe, it would throw him into extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Life.
Drunken Men muſt not be bled, becauſe the Stomach being overcharged,
ſtands in need of all its Heats to perform Digeſtion. Perſons who have
undergone a long Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, are not proper Subjects to bleed, the
Refraining from eating being a gradual and conſtant expence of blood.
<hi>Guido de Cauliaco</hi> pretends, that in ſuch Bodies as are ſoft, lax,
thin and weak, ought ſeldom to bleed; but ſuch as are fleſhy, firm and
ſound, who have large and ample Veins, may bear a more frequent Repetition of
it. Heavy Bodies which abound with groſs Humours, more eaſily ſuſtain
frequent bleeding, than Bilious Perſons whoſe Humours are more ſubtil and
fine, the blood being a ſort of check to the Bile. I do not think theſe
Rules are infallible, and always to be obſerved, ſince Bilious Perſons
are very ſubject to <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>'s, Efferveſcences of blood,
Inflammations, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions, which oblige them to have
Recourſe to Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thoſe who feed on Meats which breed Copious blood;
ſuch as Bread, and Fleſh Meats, may bear more frequent bleeding, than
Perſons who uſe a leſs nouriſhing Diet. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed Men who have craving
Wives, muſt not bleed often; the great Conſumption of Spirits in theſe
Men, aſſiſted by the Exhauſtion of their blood, would infallibly throw
them into an exereme Weakneſs. Perſons naturally Lean, bear bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better than thoſe whoſe Leanneſs proceeds from Labour, Abſtinence, Wane
of Sleep, or long Diſtempers. <hi>Celſus</hi> is <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42110:65"/>of
Opinion, that Fat and full Bodies beſt of all bear bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that it is
healthy for them. Women ought not to bleed ſo often as Men: their Bodies
being more tender, lax, delicate and ſoft than Men, and by conſequence more
porons and perſpirable, not to mention thoſe Monthly Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations of blood,
which excuſe them from this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding may be practiſed at all Times, if neceſſity
urge it. Regard is had to the properneſs of the Seaſon only in bleeding by
way of Prevention. In this Caſe the Spring is preferable to all the other
parts of the Year; becauſe the Weather growing Warm ſtirs and ferments the
Blood. The Autumn is not improper, its beginning uſually proving tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.
This bleeding for prevention, is by no means to be allowed of in very hot or
very cold Weather. Both theſe extremes are equally bad, in the firſt all
farther Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons encreaſe the expence of Spirits, and in the laſt
leſſen the Natural Warmth, and leave Men unable to bear the Rigour of the
Seaſon. If it ſhall be requiſite to bleed in exceſſive hot Weather,
chuſe ſome Day Overcaſt or Rainy, becauſe the Diſſipation of the
Spirits is not ſo great at ſuch times. Bleeding in the Morning, is better
than any other part of the Day, eſpecially in Mechanicks and Labouring Men;
becauſe the Reparation of the Spirits by the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Nights Sleep, put the
Patient in a condition to bear the Operation. If any Buſineſs or Accident
hinders bleeding at that time, defer it till Night going to Bed, the Repoſe
of the Night, ſoon giving the blood opportunity of reſuming its ordinary
Courſe. Perſons uſually bleeding at certain times, muſt continue this
Cuſtom, the Omiſſion of which, will certainly endanger a loſs of
Health.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> forbids bleeding in Big-bellyed Women;
for fear of Abortions. He tells us, Sect. 5. Aphor. 31. <hi>A Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellyed Woman
if ſhe be bled Miſcarries, if the</hi> Foetus <hi>be very far
advanced.</hi> The Veneration paid to this great Man, muſt not oblige
Phyſicians to follow his Sentiments to the Letter. Experience ſhews,
ſeveral Women with Child have been ſaved by Bleeding, and that very Copious
too; for more ample Account of this, I ſhall refer the Reader to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on Deliveries, where is related the Hiſtory of a Woman, who was bled eight
and forty times during her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child, to free her from a Cruel
Oppreſſion, which threatned her with Suffocation, notwithſtanding which,
ſhe was delivered of a living Child. However this Famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42110:66"/>muſt not be abuſed, to encourage the too bold uſe of
the Lancet in theſe Caſes. Bleeding in Women firſt with Child is
dangerous; becauſe the <hi>Placenta</hi> not adhering firmly to the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> in the beginning ſeparates, the Blood is the Life of the
Animal, decays the Conſtitution, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an Abortion: But if a Woman
have a great Repletion, and her Veſſels be overcharged with Blood, an
Evacuation is neceſſary to prevent ill Accidents.</p>
                  <p>The inconveniences which uſually require bleeding in
Big-bellied Women are Laſſitude, Heavineſs of Body, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Pains,
Difficulty of Breathing, Vomiting, Flux of Blood from the Noſe or Womb,
Varicoſe ſwellings of the Legs, obſtinate pain in the Teeth, Falls,
violent Commotions or Diſturbances of Mind, all which put the Blood and
Spiris into Diſorder. But here it is ever to be obſerved, that in bleeding
Big-bellyed Women, the Evacuation muſt not be exceeding large, upon any
pretence whatever, for fear of a <hi>Syncope</hi> and Abortion.</p>
                  <p>Women with Child are commonly bled in the ſeventh and ninth
Month, and ſometimes there is a neceſſity of bleeding them in their
Labour, to facilitate their Delivery. Maids muſt never be bled, without
firſt enquiring, if they have their Courſes on them. Young Girls who never
had, and are now of an Age proper to expect their Courſes, muſt not be
bled. Bleeding in this critical Juncture, eſpecially in the Arm, unavoidably
defers the Evacuation, and perhaps may endanger the Patient's Life. Young
unmarryed Women, ought not to be clandeſtinely bled in the Houſe where they
live, without the Knowledge of the Family: If ſuch Perſon come to a
Surgeons Houſe, and deſire to be bled, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of preventing ſome
Diſtemper; it I confeſs is ſomething a Nice caſe, for if you bleed her
never ſo little, if ſhe apprehends her ſelf to be with Child, ſhe may
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind her Arm, and make as great an Evacuation as ſhe pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>The moſt General Rule in reſpect of bleeding is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to
have recourſe to it without neceſſity; for the blood is the Life of the
Animal; In ſhort, if it were poſſible to refrain, all together, it would
be beſt for, as <hi>Fernciius</hi> ſets it forth; it waſts the Blood and
Spirits, decays the Conſtitution, precipitates thoſe who uſe it into an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely old Age, and leaves the Body ſubject to numerous Infirmities, as
Dropſies, Gout, <hi>Tremors</hi> and Palſies. There is a pernicious Opinion
prevailing amongſt ſome People, that <pb n="103" facs="tcp:42110:66"/>the firſt
bleeding certainly ſaves the Patient's Life, upon which fooliſh Confidence,
many People deferring this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to Extremity, have periſhed.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding is to be avoided after remarkable <hi>Criſes,</hi>
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Vomiting, Fluxes of the Belly or Urine, Voiding of Blood,
Defluxions or Abſceſſes, becauſe theſe Evacuations weaken the
Patient. Bleeding muſt be forborn, or at leaſt very rarely uſed in
Dropſical Patients, and thoſe who have <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,</hi> or Perſons
Emaciated and worn out with long Illneſs. It is not a proper time to bleed
immediately after Meals (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this obſtructs Digeſtion, and the
Patient vomits up his Meat) nor immediately after any violent Exerciſe, when
the Spirits are ſpent; nor in decayed Stomachs, where the loſs of Blood
muſt infallibly encreaſe the Deficiency of the Spirits; nor in the firſt
attacks or encreaſe of a Fever, the Patient being at that time unable to
ſuſtain it.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding is a proper Remedy in the beginning of hot
Abſceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to leſſen the Matter which feeds them. It is of
wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſe at firſt in great Wounds, to Anticipate Inflammations,
Fevers, Fluxion, and the ill Accidents uſually attending them, and for the
ſame Reaſons, it is exceeding ſerviceable in all Fractures and
Diſlocations of the Bones; But in all theſe caſes it ought to be
moderate.</p>

                     <p>The Arteries are diſtinguiſhed from the Veins by their
Beating, whereas the Veins have no ſenſible Motion. The Blood in the
Arteries, is of a more lively Florid Searlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, more Subtil and
Spirituous than that of the Veins; it ſprings by repeated Jets, which the
Venal Blood do's not. The Arteries lie more deeply conceal'd in the Part, and
the Veins more ſhallow and ſuperficial.</p>
                     <p>The Veins may be opened without any danger, if nothing be
hurt beſides the Veſſels; but the Punction of the Arteries is ever
attended with troubleſom Accidents, as Aneuriſms, Difficulty of ſtopping
the Blood, and Death after, if theſe Swellings by neglect, or ill management
degenerate and gangrene. The pricking of an Artery which lies deep, is ſtill
more dangerous, becauſe no Ligature or Reſtringent Remedies can be
applyed.</p>
                     <p>The Vein running through the middle of the Forehead, is
called the Frontal Vein, or <hi>Vena praeparans. Hippocrates</hi> directs the
opening this Vein in pains of the hinder part of the Head, and at preſent it
is practiſed in inveterate Pains of <pb n="104" facs="tcp:42110:67"/>that Part, whereever
they reſide. In the ſame caſe the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Arteries are ſometimes
opened: Theſe Arteries alone can be opened, becauſe they are ſmall, and
may be compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Boulſter and Bandage; This advantage they
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from running over the Bone, which with the External Applications,
compoſe a double Compreſs.</p>
                     <p>The Veins in the greater Angle of the Eye, are opened to
prevent their Inflammation; and the Veins between the Cartilages of the Noſe,
to take off the Copper Colour, and other Deformities in the Skin of the Face.
The opening of the Veins on each ſide the <hi>Fraenum</hi> of the Tongue,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Venae Ranulares,</hi> is practiſed in Inflammations of
the Throat, and Pains of the Teeth, when the uſual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies fail. Bleeding
in the Jugulars, is very effectual to prevent all Quinſies, Apoplexies, and
all ſtubborn Diſtempers of the Head, eſpecially Inflammations of the
Eyes.</p>
                     <p>There are four Veins in the Arm, in which it is common to
let Blood, the <hi>Cephalick, Median, Baſilick</hi> and <hi>Cubital.</hi> The
Firſt is in the upper and external part of the foreſide of the Arm, near
the bending of the Elbow. The <hi>Baſilick</hi> is a little lower, and the
<hi>Cubital</hi> at the bottom of the Arm on the Bone of the Cubit, or near it.
When the Veſſels lied<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ep, and cannot be opened, there appear on the inner part of the
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Arm, from the Elbow to the Wriſt, ſeveral commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
Branches, which convey the Blood from one to the other, and theſe may be
opened in ſtead of the principal Veins. On the Hand are two Veins, one
between the Thumb and forefinger, and another between the laſt Finger, and
the laſt but one called <hi>Salvatella,</hi> and ſometimes opened in
<hi>Quartan Agues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral Veins on the Leg and Foot opened, to
give Relief to the Patient. In the upper part of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi
Gemelli,</hi> there is one called <hi>Poplitea,</hi> the opening of which is
uſeful in the Gout, and prevents Varicoſe Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Leggs. The
<hi>Saphaena</hi> is opened above and below the Internal Ancle. This Vein
continues its courſe on the Foot, quite to the Juncture of the great Toe, and
may be opened there: In opening it above the Ancle, great care muſt be taken
not to prick a Nerve, which terminates in that place, and on the Foot not to
hurt the Tendons. There is another Vein which winds round the extremity of the
ſame Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, called the <hi>Sciatica;</hi> from the opinion that,
abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood drawn out thence, appeaſes pains of the Hip-Gout. The
<hi>Saphaena</hi> and <hi>Sciatica,</hi> ſpread numerous <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42110:67"/>Branches on the Foot, which may be opened when the great Trunks do not
appear.</p>
                     <p>The opening of a Vein is done after two ſeveral ways,
either by Pricking or Cutting. The larger are cut, but the leſſer and
thoſe which lie deep, admit only of ſimple Punction; as the Veins of the
Noſe, where the adjacent parts would be hurt, if the Point of the Lancet were
rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Inciſions are made after three ſeveral manners, Length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
Tranſverſe, or Oblique, and greater or leſſer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the
largeneſs and depth of the Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>To open the Veins more conveniently; Firſt ſtop the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent Blood with a Ligature, except there be a Varicoſe Swelling, where
the Circulation of the Blood being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the Veſſels are tumid
enough without any Artificial Help.</p>
                     <p>In Bleeding Delirious Perſons, the Veſſels are ſo
exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large, and Diſtended by the furious agitation of the Blood, that
for the moſt part there is no occaſion for Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Reaſon of which
is plain from the Laws of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
                     <p>The Frontal Vein may be opened lengthways when it is
rowling, and Tranſverſly when it is ſteady. But in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever manner it be
opened, the Lancet muſt be held incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for fear if it were plunged
Perpendicularly in, it might hurt the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and the ſubjacent
Bone.</p>
                     <p>The Veins and Arteries of the Temples, may be opened in two
places, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Temporal Muſcles, or under the Lobe of the
External Ear, at the entry of the <hi>Meatus Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius.</hi> On the Temporal
Muſcles, theſe Atteries muſt be opened lengthways, to prevent dividing
their Fibres, which may happen to be followed by a huge Swelling of the Head,
<hi>Delirium</hi> and Convulſions. The Fear of ſuch bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
ought to make a Surgeon who values his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cautious of hurting theſe
Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>The Vein in the Greater Angle of the Eye, muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
lengthways, leaſt a Tranſverſe Section hurt the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Oblique
Muſcle, and cauſe a Deformity in the Part; But it is much better to forbear
medling with this, for fear of hurting the Lachrymal Gland.</p>
                     <p>To open the Vein in the Noſe, plunge a Lancer directly
down, and pretty deep in the extremity of the Noſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two
Cartilages. This Lancet muſt be kept in its Scales, by a Tape wrapt round it,
and only plunged in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out raiſing its Point: For the Veſſel lies ſo
low, that if the <pb n="106" facs="tcp:42110:68"/>Elevation of the point were anſwerable
to the depth of the Punction, the Orifice would be very large, and leave a
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſeemly Scar. The Veins on each ſide the <hi>Fraenum</hi> of the
Tongue, are opened with a Lancet wrapt round with a little Tape to its point.
The Tongue is to be raiſed with the left Hand, and with the right a ſmall
Tranſverſe inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, which muſt not be too deep, for fear of
opening the Arteries, which lie very near the Veins. If theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be
cut, the Flux of Blood will prove difficult to ſtop, ſince no Dreſſing
can be applied to the Part. When the Patient has bled enough, let him waſh
his Mouth with cold <hi>Oxycrate;</hi> If this be not ſufficient, apply to
the Wound ſome Reſtringent Powders of <hi>Terra Sigillata, Dragons Blood,
Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> or keep a ſmall Compreſs dipt in Mons. <hi>Lemery's</hi>
Styp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Water on it.</p>
                     <p>To bleed all the Veins of the Head, it is neceſſary to
make a Ligature round the Neck, becauſe the Blood ſent to the Head by the
Arteries, is conveyed back to the Heart by the Jugulars, and the Ligature
cauſes them to ſwell. Sharp, ſtrong Lancets are required to open the
Veins of the Neck, becauſe the Skin is very lax here, and more difficultly
open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than in other parts where it is more Tenſe, and the Veins muſt be
opened lengthways, becauſe they are large and unſteady.</p>
                     <p>In making a Ligature on the Jugulars, the middle of the
Fillet is to be applyed behind on the Neck, the two Ends brought before, turn'd
over each other, and put into the Patients Hand, to ſtraiten them as he finds
he can bear; or if he by any Accident be diſabled, an Aſſiſtant muſt
hold them for him till the Work be finiſhed. In Apoplexies and Quinſies, no
Ligature can be made without danger of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focating the Patient. In ſtead of
this, the Artiſt muſt order one of the ſtanders by to keep his Thumb on
the bottom of the Vein of the oppoſite ſide, in the Cavity of the
Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and preſs the ſame ſide in which he Deſigns to bleed with
one of his own Thumbs, thruſting in the Lancet with his other Hand. The two
Veins thus Compreſt Tumefie, and may be well enough opened, without
ſtraitning the Windpipe. To ſtop the Blood, apply to the Wound
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich</hi> ſpread on Rags or Leather. The Reader will find a proper
Bandage for bleeding in the Neck, deſcribed in the Dreſſings; becauſe a
ſimple Emplaſter often is not ſufficient to ſtop the Blood, when it is
in a violent Commotion.</p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42110:68"/>
                     <p>In opening the Veins of the Hands and Feet, the Parts are to
be plunged in Water, as hot as the Patient can well endure it. This is done as
well to make the Skin tender, as to raiſe the Veins.</p>
                     <p>The Veins of the Hands are to be opened lengthways, for fear
of hurting <hi>the Tendons which abound there by a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Section,</hi> and the Ligature is to be made above the Part intended for
Bleeding. In opening the Veins of the Ham, or <hi>Vena Poplitea,</hi> a
Ligature muſt be made above the Knee; The Orifice muſt be made
Tranſverſe, and proportioned to the largeneſs of the Veſſel.</p>
                     <p>The Surgeon ought to have an eſpecial care, leaſt the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient faint: This happens ſometimes in the Operation, and ſometimes
after. To avoid this Accident at the time of Bleeding, the Surgeon muſt
enquire, If he be commonly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to faint upon the like occaſion; If he
has been long faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; If he do's not find himſelf inclin'd to go to
Stool. If he uſually faint in Bleeding, he muſt be bled lying along in his
Bed, take cold Water in his Mouth, be diverted from looking on his Blood,
entertained with ſome agreeable Relation, have Vinegar put to his Noſe to
ſmell too, or ſome Spiritous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as <hi>Spirit of Wine, Orange-Flower
Water, Queen of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary's Water,</hi> or Laſtly, take a Spoonful of Wine, or
ſome other Reſtorative.</p>
                     <p>It is by no means convenient to bleed any Perſon
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his Stomach is filled with Meat; for the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which
the loſs of blood cauſes, is followed by Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for fear of which
Miſchief, it is beſt to ſtay till Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Surgeon muſt bleed Perſons ſubject to faint, lying
down: The ſame Poſture is proper for Perſons weakned, and worn out with
long Illneſs. But this is only to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Bleeding in the Hand or
Foot; for bleeding in the Head or Neck, neceſſarily requires the Patient to
be a little raiſed. A Stout Robuſt Man, who is not daunted with bleeding,
may be bled ſitting in a Chair, or in his Bed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the part be.
Bleeding in the Veins of the Hams, and Varicoſe Swellings, muſt be done,
the Patient ſtanding erect, becauſe then the Veſſels riſe beſt.</p>
                     <p>The Surgeon may Operate in three ſeveral Poſtures,
Standing, Sitting, or Kneeling. He muſt be ſtanding to bleed in the Head,
Neck and Arm, ſitting to bleed in the Foot, or kneeling if he cannot find a
convenient Seat. Laſtly, He is often conſtrained to kneel on the Bed to
bleed <pb n="108" facs="tcp:42110:69"/>ſuch Patients as are exhauſted by long
Sickneſs, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear the leaſt ſtirring.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes when a Surgeon is called to miſerably poor
People, all Conveniences are wanting, even ſo much as a Fillet to bind the
part; in this caſe he muſt make the beſt ſhift he can, and accommodate
himſelf to the neceſſity of the place.</p>
                     <p>A good Light is of wonderful Service to a Surgeon in all
Operations, but eſpecially in Bleeding, and the Succeſs of this nice
Operation, depends very much on the well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that. He muſt never if
poſſible, do it by the light of the Sun; becauſe his own Hand, or the
Patients Arm cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a ſhadow. If the Operation be done by the Light of a
Candle, though a great Wax Taper give a better Light than an ordinary Candle,
yet it is never to be made uſe of; leaſt if a drop of Wax by any Accident
ſhould fall, it might ſcald the Arm, and the Patient draw it back, whereas
a drop of Tallow would be ſcarce ſenſible, at leaſt create no very
troubleſom Pain.</p>
                     <p>If the Perſon be very Hairy ſhave the part, eſpecially
if it be the Foot or Hand. When hot Water is neceſſary to bath the part
before bleeding, all above the place intended for the Operation muſt be
bathed, eſpecially if the Veſſels be large, and lie deep. And to make the
Patient able to bear the hot Water, the part muſt be firſt plunged in warm
Water only, and hotter ſtill gradually pour'd in, till the Patient is no
longer able to endure it. If the Veins of the Arms are difficult to find, the
whole Limb muſt be bathed in hot Water. The moſt convenient Veſſel for
which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is a long Kettle, ſuch as is uſed to boil Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>The Surgeon ought to have an exquiſite Senſe at the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of his Fingers, and to preſerve this, muſt not uſe any
Laborious or Mechanical Occupation, muſt not touch any rough Objects, muſt
have a great care of Burns, (all which leave the Skin Thick and Callous,) and
Wine and Women, which create <hi>Tremors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Surgeon muſt be provided with Ligatures, Lancets, and
proper Veſſels to receive and meaſure the Blood. He muſt have diverſe
ſorts of Fillers, ſome longer for Perſons of better Faſhion, and ſome
leſſer for ordinary and mean People. He muſt never uſe the ſame to
ſound Bodies, and thoſe who have any Cutaneous Diſeaſe, as the Itch,
Small Pox, Meazles, Carbuncles, Malignant or ſpotted Fevers, for fear of
communicating the Infection.</p>
                     <p>If the Veſſels to be opened lie deep, a long, ſtreight
Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is the moſt proper
to be uſed; for if it ſhould be broad, <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42110:69"/>the Orifice
would be too large. Superficial and rowling Veſſels, muſt be opened with
larger Lancets, whoſe points are firm and ſtable. Infants require
leſſer Lancets than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Surgeons who daily practiſe bleeding, may receive blood in
any ſort of Veſſels, and gueſs pretty well at the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at leaſt
without being much deceived, but in great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and Feeble, Weak,
Exhauſted Subjects, they ought if poſſible to have Veſſels to
meaſure exactly the Blood, as ſmall Porringers of three or four Ounces. It
is proper for an Artiſt to practiſe the trying, how much two or three of
theſe Porringers hold in any Houſhold Veſſel, that in defect of
theſe, he may at any time gueſs the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood emitted.</p>
                     <p>When the Blood is not received in Porringers, as in
bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hand or Foot in warm Water, the quantity of blood is
gueſſed, computed by the largeneſs of the Orifice, the time of its
running, and the Tincture it gives to Linen, found either by dipping Rags in
it, taking up a little in the Hand, and dropping it on a clean Napkin.</p>
                     <p>If the Blood be received in any other Veſſels beſides
Porringers, to judge aright of the quantity they muſt not be too wide, but of
a reaſonable depth, becauſe theſe are leſs apt to impoſe on the
Senſes, than more ſhallow and wide ones, in which the Blood appears of a
more Florid Scarlet colour.</p>
                     <p>Before the Artiſt proceed to open a Veſſel, it is
neceſſary to make a Ligature ſufficient to ſtop the Refluent Blood. In
performing his Work, he muſt alike ſhun the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of Boldneſs and
Fear: For on the one Hand, ſome Timorous Men apprehending they may hurt the
Contiguous parts, do not make a ſufficient Orifice, while on the other,
ſome raſh Surgeons without Fear or Wit, commit very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errors.</p>
                     <p>There are four Particulars in this Operation, the Right
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Ligature, the well Holding the Lancet, the Searching for the
moſt proper place for the Aperture; and laſtly, the Artful opening the
Veſſel.</p>
                     <p>The Ligature is ever to be made above the intended
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture, except in the Head and Neck, where it is below.</p>
                     <p>When the Vein lies deep, and difficult to come at, ſome
Surgeons make two oppoſite Ligatures, or make three turns of the Fillet round
the Limb, or ſow a ſmall Boulſter of Linen Cloth, three or four times
double, on the middle of the Fillet, or place where it is applyed, to make a
more exact <pb n="110" facs="tcp:42110:70"/>compreſſion on the Part, and theſe ſort
of Ligatures they call <hi>Pontons.</hi> But all theſe are miſtaken
Methods, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ignorance of the Cauſes. The Ligature with the
Boulſter, fails of the intended effect; becauſe ſome Veſſels being
leſs compreſt than others, the Blood aſcends by ſome, whilſt it is
intercepted in others; and for this Reaſon, one which equally compreſſes
all, is to be preferred. The third turn is unneceſſary, ſince the firſt
two are ſufficient to make any Conſtriction deſired, by binding them
ſtreighter, and inconvenient, becauſe when the bleeding is over and this
undone, there remain two more to be loos'd. The two oppoſite Ligatures tend
more to hinder, than promote the Riſing of the Vein. The upper has no other
effect in ſtopping the current of the Blood, after the lower is made, except
it be to retain a ſmall proportion of it, in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening ſpace between
it and the lower; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it puts ſome ſtop to the Blood
paſſing through the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the Arteries into the Part, and ſo
leſſens the Riſing of the Veins below the Ligature. So that doubtleſs
the beſt way of making a Ligature on any part in letting Blood, is by two
ſimple turns of the Fillet, exactly over one another; which may be
conſtringed or relaxed at pleaſure, by ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or looſing the
Ends near the Knot, which ſtays them.</p>
                     <p>The Ligature muſt be made at ſome reaſonable
diſtance above the place intended for bleeding; for inſtance, about the
breadth of two Fingers. Thus in bleeding in the Arm, it ought to be placed
about two Fingers breadth above the Juncture of the Elbow, at the ſame
diſtance from the Fiſt and Ancles, in bleeding in the Hand or Foot. At the
ſame Diſtance above the <hi>Rotula</hi> of the Knee, in opening the Veins
of the Hamms, and in all bleeding of the Head and Jugulars, in the loweſt
part of the Neck.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gormans</hi> and other Foreign Nations, make uſe
of the Fleam in bleeding; But our Lancets being more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and this now
grown obſolete, I ſhall omit deſcribing it. But here the Invention of the
<hi>Americans</hi> muſt not be forgot, who to ſupply the defect of Iron,
unknown to them before their Commerce with <hi>Europe,</hi> made Lancets of
ſharpned Flints and Bones.</p>
                     <p>The Surgeon in bleeding muſt open his Lancet in ſuch a
manner, that it may make a Right Angle with its Scales, except in opening the
Veins of the Tongue or Noſtrils, where the Lancet is wrapt round with a Tape
in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that both it and its Scales ſtand in one right Line. 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42110:70"/>The way of holding the Lancet is very different, ſome
hold it very long, others ſhort, for my part I prefer the middle way. If it
be held too long, it is difficult to direct aright, eſpecially if the Skin be
dry and unſteady. On the other hand in holding it too near its Point, there
is not room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a ſufficient Punction in Fat Bodies, or ſuch as
have their Veſſels lying deep. The Lancet is beſt held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Thumb
and Forefinger, not the Thumb and two Middle-fingers, or Thumb Fore and
Middle-finger, as ſome direct. The three laſt Fingers ſerve for a ſtay
to the Hand, to keep it firm and ſtable, and are to reſt a little on the
part below, and on one ſide the Orifice, which is a more commendable way than
Bully like, to run the Lancet into the Veſſel, without regard to Security.
The Aperture is to be made in the place which repreſents it ſelf faireſt,
except ſome Neighbouring Artery, Tendon or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane forbid.</p>
                     <p>The Operation in opening a Veſſel, conſiſts of three
parts; Punction, Inciſion, and Raiſing the Point of the Lancet. All theſe
are to be ſo promptly done, that to the Spectator they may appear but one
Action. The Surgeon ought to be provided with all Neceſſaries, and to have
at leaſt two Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants by him if poſſible, one to hold the
Candle, (when neceſſary) and Porringer, and the other to do him any
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice occaſion ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>In Bleeding in the Arm, after the Patient is put in a good
Poſture, and the Bed covered with Linen to receive the Blood which ſprings
out at firſt ſomething impetuouſly, and (without this Care to prevent it)
would be apt to ſtain the Bed-cloths. The next thing is to tuck up and
faſten the Patients Sleeve, and cover it with a Napkin, for fear any Blood
may happen to be ſpilt upon it. Theſe little Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, though not very
Material to the thing it ſelf, yet are apt to beget a Favourable Opinion of
the Artiſt in the Mind of the Patient, who from obſerving theſe minute
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his proceeding, is apt to conclude him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and
dextrous.</p>
                     <p>When this previous Buſineſs is done, the Surgeon muſt
feel the inſide of the Arm in all places where the Veins ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to
diſcover where the Artery lies. This is diſcerned by the Pulſe or
Beating, which is not ſenſible after the Ligature is made; and therefore it
is to be found before. The Ligature as I noted before, is to be placed two
Fingers breadth or ſomething more, above the Flexure of the Elbow, to paſs 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42110:71"/>twice round the Arm, and be tyed with a Bow knot on its
out ſide. The firſt round muſt not be altogether ſo ſtrait as the
ſecond, and the Skin not forcibly extended, by drawing it up or down, leaſt
upon relaxing a little, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature to give way to the Blood iſſuing out,
the Orifice cloſe and obſtruct the Paſſage.</p>
                     <p>After the Ligature is made, ſome little time muſt be
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the Veins to ſwell, during which the Surgeon may open his
Lancer, put it in his Mouth, take again the Patients Arm in his Hand, and
(making ſeveral Frictions, drive up the Blood towards the place intended for
the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;) feel the Veſſels with his Fingers, and chuſe out ſome
place for the Aperture, which anſwers beſt. This Anſwering is a gentle
Reſiſtance, which yields to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Compreſſion, and Reſiſts
the Finger, if the Compreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be very ſlight. But obſerve here, this
anſwering of the Vein may be very deceitful, eſpecially in the middle of
the Flexure of the Arm, when numerous Scars have made a ſort of ſmall
<hi>Sinus,</hi> which may impoſe on the ſenſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like a Vein on
the Surface, when the Real Vein lies much deeper.</p>
                     <p>After a long while feeling too and fro, if no Vein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
which can be opened with any tolerable Security, Frictions with hot Cloths are
to be uſed, and continued for a conſiderable time. Or the Ligature taken
off, and the Arm plunged in hot Water bound up again, and Frictions us'd as
before. If after all theſe ways tryed, no Veſſel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear capable of being
opened, it is more adviſable to deſiſt, than bleed at all Adventures, as
ſome Raſhly do on the Scars of old Orifices. This Practice is occaſioned
by the hopes of finding the ſame Veſſels, which is a miſtake, ſince
the Veins change their Situation under the Skin, according to the Age or good
Caſe of the Body; nay, ſome Veſſels are ſo leſſened by frequent
Bleeding, they at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſcarce ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>If after a Careful Tryal, the Surgeon comes to diſcover a
Veſſel which lies deep, he muſt aſſure himſelf well of the Place by
ſeveral feelings, and rub the part with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Oyl to ſupple it, and
facilitate the entring of the Lancer, eſpecially if the Skin be dry, rough
and ſcurfy: Laſtly, to ſecure the place of the Vein, he muſt make an
impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his Nail, which may ſerve to guide him.</p>
                     <p>After the Artiſt has obſerved theſe Circumſtances,
graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Patient Arm in one Hand, he muſt take the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42110:71"/>in the other, and holding its Blade firmly in the middle,
between his Forefinger and Thumb (ſtaying his three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Fingers on the
Patients Arm) thruſt it in preciſely in the loweſt part of the
Impreſſion made with his Nail, and curcing a little Tranſverſely,
raiſe up its Point to cut through the Veſſel and Teguments, and widen the
Orifice. If he ſuſpect the Lancer to be plunged in too deep, he may draw it
a little back, before he brings up its point. Cutting Tranſverſly is the
ſureſt way not to miſs the Veſſel, and large Orifices are to be
preſerred to ſmall ones, for the free emiſſion of the Blood. The
largeneſs of the Orifice is more neceſſary in Veſſels which lie deep,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fleſh and Fat is apt to choak the paſſage, and hinder the
Evacuation. Add to this in the laſt place, that ſmall Orifices are apt to
leave <hi>Thrombu's</hi> behind them.</p>
                     <p>In Bleeding in the Arm, the Surgeon muſt feel all over it
with his Forefinger for the Artery, which commonly lies under the Baſilick
Vein. I obſerved before, that this Search is neceſſary before the
Ligature be made, becauſe after it the Veins are Tumefied, and the
Pulſation is not ſenſible. The next Search is after the Tendons, which
are diſcovered in bending the Arm by their Rigidity. When the place of the
Artery and Tendon is certainly known, the Ligature is made two Fingers breadth
above the Bending of the Elbow, and place of the intended Orifice. The middle
of the Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let is to be applyed on the Arm, and paſſing twice round it, to
be tyed behind: The knot is beſt placed above the Joynt, leaſt if it be
below it incommode that Hand which holds the Patients Arm; The Ligature muſt
not be ſo ſtrait, as to compreſs the Arteries which import Blood into the
part; it is enough if it be ſufficient to ſtop the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Blood in
the Veins.</p>
                     <p>In Bleeding in the Right Hand, the Surgeon muſt take the
Patients Arm in his Left Hand, and prick him with his Right; and on the
contrary, in the Left he muſt take it in the Right, and bleed him with his
Left. Before the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is neceſſary to conſider well which
Veſſel is faireſt, that is largeſt, and which has leaſt danger in it;
for in caſe the Artery adhere to it, it is better to prick the leſſer,
than run any hazard in the greater. The Cephalick is the moſt ſecure of all
the Veins of the Arm, having no Artery or Tendon accompanying it, and yet
Surgeons are not very willing to bleed in it; becauſe the Skin on the upper
ſide <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42110:72"/>of the Arm is pretty thick, and the Blood do's only
flow down the Arm without ſpringing, which do's not ſo well pleaſe the
Patient, who when the Blood ſprings out, thinks the Operation better
performed, and is fond to have it thought he has a great deal of Vigour. If the
Veſſel lies deep, and is not Viſible, which often happens in the thick
Arms of ſome Women, in order to find it, he muſt graſp the Arm in one
Hand, compreſſing the place where the Veſſels ought to appear with his
Thumb, and with the other Hand make ſeveral Frictions upwards, preſſing
the Veſſels all along to ſee if he can diſcover any Blood ſtrike
againſt his Thumb. When he finds any Veſſel under his Thumb, he muſt
take it inſtantly off, marking the place with his Nail, and then prick a
little below the impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>The Punction is made with the Lancet, either with or without
raiſing the Point. In the firſt way the Surgeon takes the Lancet between
the Thumb and Fore-finger, meeting even (not too long, becauſe it would not
be ſteady, nor too ſhort, becauſe it would be Troubleſom;) and then
reſting his three other Fingers on the Patient's Arm, plunges his Lancet into
the Veſſel, a little on one ſide, and when he is in raiſes its Point,
and ſo cuts through it. This is the beſt Method of Operating, when there
are no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt it, but it is the moſt Painful.</p>
                     <p>In bleeding without raiſing the Point, the Lancet is held
in the ſame manner as before, plunged directly into the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel a little
beneath, and ſo brought forward without turning up its Point; This way is
leſs painful that the former, but in ſome Caſes is not without Danger. If
the Tendon or Artery lie directly under the Vein, this laſt Method is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be uſed, becauſe it requires deeper Punction, and there is great Danger
of hurting one of them; On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if either lie on the ſide, there is
ground to fear they may be cut by raiſing the point. But obſerve which
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of theſe ways be practiſed, the Lancet muſt be held ſomething
inclining, and not too Perpendicularly over the Vein, leaſt entring in this
Manner, it prick the Membrane of the Muſcles, from whence great Pain and
Inflammation would enſue.</p>
                     <p>In Veins running over great Muſcles, the Puncture is made
obliquely upwards; for in pricking directly down, it is ſcarce poſſible
to avoid hurting the Membranes, which inveſt the Subjacent Muſcle, which
will be attended with Pain and Inflammation.</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42110:72"/>
                     <p>If one Veſſel only appear fair, and that be accompanyed
with a Tendon or Artery, the beſt way is to trace it through its whole
Progreſs, till it leaves them, and where it appears alone, there make the
Puncture. This is the way of Bleeding in the Arm. The Dreſſing I ſhall
deſcribe below, in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>For Bleeding in the Leg, the Part is to be kept in warm
Water to the mid Leg. This is done to bring the Blood more copiouſly into it,
and ſoften the Skin which is very thick in that place. When the Part is well
heated. the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt ſearches for the Veſſel above or below the Ancle,
makes a Ligature about two or three Fingers breadth above it, ties it
ſtreight enough to compreſs the Vein without preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Artery, puts
the Foot again into hot Water to give the Vein time to Swell. Then (the Patient
ſitting on the ſide of his Bed, and he in a Chair before him) he lays the
Foot on his Knee, graſping it in one Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Bleeding with the other.

the ill Conſequence of which, would be violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and Pain. On the
ſide of the Ancle there are diverſe Tendons, which ought to make the
Surgeon cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: When the Veſſels on the Internal Ancle are not fair,
they appear for the moſt part fair on the Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I would not adviſe
bleeding here, upon account of the numerous Tendons which are in great Danger
of being pricked, but if it be neceſſary, he muſt enter very
obliquely.</p>
                     <p>For Bleeding in the Jugulars, a Conſtriction muſt be
made with a Handkerchief, ſufficient to make the Veſſels riſe, and the
Orifice be made lengthways of the Veſſel, in its middle.</p>
                     <p>In all Bleeding this may be accounted a General Rule. If the
Veſſel be very large the Aperture is to be made in its mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lengthways;
If of a middle ſize, as in the Arm, a little on one ſide, and ſomething
obliquely from above down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; If very ſmall, as in Infants, then it is to
be cut Tranſverſly.</p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:42110:73"/>
                     <p>It is a general Rule likewiſe, That in what ever Veins of
the Head the Evacuation be made, the Ligature muſt ever be about the Neck. In
Diſtempers of the Head, the great Vein in the midſt of the Fore-head, and
the Veins under the Tongue are often opened, but doubtleſs the Jugulars are
beſt in moſt of theſe Caſes, to make the moſt prompt and copious
Evacuation.</p>
                     <p>In Bleeding under the Tongue after the Ligature made, it is
raiſed, held againſt the Palate, and then the Vein open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Blood
ſtopped with a good Reſtringent Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, if it do not ceaſe of it
ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Arteries are opened in the ſame manner as Veins, but
theſe are never to be pricked, unleſs where they immediately paſs over
ſome Bone, which no other Arteries in the Body do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe of the
Head; the Principal of which for this Operation, is the Temporal. Dr.
<hi>Willis</hi> pretends, Arteries are opened more Succeſsfully than Veins,
in Obſtructions and Inflammations, as for inſtance of the Eyes, becauſe
they contract and retire within the Fleſh, are Cicatrized there, and ceaſe
from their Office of conveying blood to the Part.</p>
                     <p>After Inciſion made, when the Impetuoſity of the Blood
begins to abate, the Ligature muſt be a little relaxed; that as much Blood
may paſs into the Part by the Arteries, as will ſuffice for the intended
Evacuation. Farther for promoting the Diſcharge, ſome little round thing as
a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet-caſe, or the like, is to be put into the Patients Hand, to turn
about with the extremity of his Fingers only; This Action cauſes a
Contraction of the Muſcles of the Arm, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sublimis</hi>
and <hi>Profundus,</hi> which are Flexors of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and by this means
they expreſs the Blood in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels running on their inſide, and
accelerate its Motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orifice. In Bleeding in the Throat, the
ſame thing is effected by gently moving the lower Jaw, and in the Foot, by
ſtirring the Great Toe. All the time the Blood is running, the Surgeon muſt
hold the Patients Arm with one Hand, in which there is a double Convenience;
Firſt, the eaſing and ſupporting the Part, which is heavy by the great
quantity of Blood and Spirits ſtopt in it: And Secondly, the advantage of
bending and extending it as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. With his other Hand he
may diſtend the Skin, drawing it upwards, downwards, or on one ſide, to
make the outward Orifice anſwer to that Vein.</p>
                     <p>When the intended quantity of Blood is drawn out, the Arm
muſt be unbound, and the Surgeon with his Finger <pb n="117" facs="tcp:42110:73"/>muſt
preſs around the Orifice, leaſt any Blood happen to Stagnate under the
Skin. The Wound muſt be exactly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by cloſing it on both ſides
with the Forefinger and Middle finger; but if the Fat come out, this muſt
firſt be put back by a Compreſs in one Hand, with the other Hand pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together the Lips of the Wound, between the Thumb and Forefinger.</p>
                     <p>While the Surgeon is buſied in ſtopping the Orifice, the
Servant who held the Porringer which received the Blood, muſt ſet it down
on the Table gently, and ſtrike it over with a Feather, or ſome other light
thing to take off the Froth. This Trifling Circumſtance has its uſe, to
diſcover the true Colour of the Blood, and amuſe the People who moſt
commonly are admirers of ſuch Myſterious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>THE DRESSING. This conſiſts only in applying a little,
thick, ſquare Compreſs on the Orifice, and keeping it on by binding up the
Arm. Before this be laid on, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon muſt clear the Wound from
Coagulated Blood, which if neglected, will hinder Coalition: Then keeping the
Lips of the Orifice together with his Fingers, he muſt ſpeedily apply the
Compreſs, Staying it on with his fore and middle Finger. If any little
Flatulent Tumour appear on the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which is not uncommon when it is too
ſmall, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs dipt in cold Water diſperſes it. For binding up
the Arm, he muſt take a Fillet of about an Ell long, and an Inch and a half
broad, and gathering into his Hand three or four Inches of one end of it, and
(laying the Thumb, fore and middle Finger of his left Hand, in bleeding in the
Right Arm, or the Thumb and the ſame Fingers of his Right in bleeding in the
left Arm, on it) apply that part which he holds between his Fingers, on the
Orifice, and ſo make ſeveral Croſſes over the bending of the Elbow; and
Laſtly, when the Fillet is ſpent, bringing back that end which he held in
his Hand, he muſt tie both ends behind the Arm. Some place the Knot behind
the Arm, above the bending of the Elbow, and others below. If the Fillet be of
a firm and ſtrong Cloth, and there be no reaſon to fear the Patient will
make uſe of his Arm, the Knot is beſt placed above, on the contrary, if the
Cloth be weak and much worn below, for fear when the Patient ſhall come to
open his Arm, the Fillet break. In the laſt place, obſerve the Fillet
muſt never be rolled.</p>

length of the Fillet on his Knee, and place the Patients Heel on it, then with
the other end he muſt make a Circular Turn on the Compreſs, and an X on the
Foot; After divers Circumvolutions, he muſt bring the Fillet obliquely over

                     <p>The ſmall Compreſs applyed on the Orifice, is kept on by
the Handkerchief folded croſs, or Diagonalwiſe, in the form of a Triangle:
The Artiſt takes the Handkerchief thus folded in both Hands, with his Thumbs

brings it over this depending part, engages it under it, ſo continuing his
Circular Turns round the Parietal Bones till the Fillet is ſpent, and then

with the other end paſſes over the Parietal Bone, behind on the Nape of the

                     <p>The following Bandage is adapted to bleeding in the
Forehead, Neck, or Temporal Artery. The Artiſt takes a Fillet of three inches
in breadth, and an Ell long, this he doubles in the midſt, and ſlits it
lengthways with a pair of Sciſſars, leaving about three Inches ſquare in
the midſt plain and undivided. When it is thus divided, it is called the
Fillet or Roller, with four Tails. He applies the plain undivided part on the

conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing them each reſpectively, circularly over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pinning
them at their Ends The Reader may obſerve here as a general Rule, in applying

                     <p>The Artiſt takes a Fillet of half an Ell long, applies the

ſome Glutinating Emplaſter on the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                     <p>THE CURE. After the Bleeding is over, the Patient may lie
down and drink off a glaſs of Water, which mixing with the Blood dilutes and
cools it. The Patient is ſuffer'd to reſt for the ſpace of an Hour, and
after takes ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative Draught. It is cuſtomary to forbid the
Patient ſleeping, till he has taken this; but I profeſs I am a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Reaſon of this Practice, for in ſleeping immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after
Bleeding, Tranſpiration is free; and there ariſes a certain Dew on the
Surface of the Body, which is very refreſhing. Beſides this is the moſt
gentle, eaſie, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Slumber that can be imagined, Nature requires
it, and ſeems to have Violence done her, when this Satisfaction is denyed
her. However ſince Cuſtom prevails to the contrary, and perhaps ſome
Accidents may have attended ſleeping at this time, I would not adviſe any
Perſon to recede from the common and received Practice.</p>
                     <p>If the Phyſician has directed the Patient to be twice bled
on the ſame day, the Surgeon may put ſome Oyl or Greaſe on the Orifice,
to prevent its cloſing, and by this means ſave the trouble of making a
ſecond Puncture. The leſſer Dreſſing is not commonly taken off under
twenty four hours, or a longer time, if the Orifice be not diſpoſed to
heal. For when the Limb is too ſoon unbound, the Wound is but half clos'd,
the Air inſinuates into it, creates a little running Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which is
difficultly healed, and moleſts the Patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. The Dreſſing is
left on much longer after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Artery, than a Vein; becauſe the Blood
being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with great <hi>Impetus,</hi> would forcibly open the Orifice,
before the Coalition be perfected. When the Compreſs is to be taken off, if
it adhere to the Orifice, it is better to leave it on, or Humect it with a
little warm Wine, and ſo gently ſeparate it, than remove it by
Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:42110:76"/>
                     <p>If the Patient fall into a Swoon during the Operation, the
Surgeon muſt cauſe him to be carryed to his Bed, if he be not already in
it, fling a little cold Water in his Face, or give him ſome to drink, muſt
open the Chamber Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and draw the Curtains, if the Diſeaſe and
Seaſon of the Year permit. He muſt apply to his Noſe ſome Odoriferous
things, as good Vinegar, Queen of <hi>Hungary's</hi> Water, Spirit of Wine,
muſt call him frequently by his Name in his Ear, with as loud a Noiſe as
poſſible, and unlooſe whatever is tyed about any part of his Body. When
the Patient is come to himſelf, the Artiſt muſt place the Limb in a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Poſture, which is as various as the parts concerned. For
inſtance, after Bleeding in the Head, the Patient muſt remain quiet, and
have his Head ſupported with ſome ſoft Pillow, and lie a little inclining
rather than erect: After bleeding in the Arm, the Patient muſt avoid all
ſtirring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing on his Bed, or ſome convenient Couch, with his Arm
ſuſpended in a middle Poſture, between Bent and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: After Bleeding
in the lower Parts, he muſt keep his Bed for the ſpace of twenty four
Hours, to prevent any Fluxion or Suppuration on the place.</p>
                     <p>Moſt Perſons after Bleeding, are in ſome Diſorder,
in which I would recommend boldly drinking a large Draught of Water, as a
proper means to recall the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits determined, by opening the Vein
towards the extream parts, beſides Water mixing with the Blood, allays its
Heat. The grand Objection againſt ſleeping after Bleeding, is that Nature
is always offended by two praecipitate a Change from one Extreme to another;
That it muſt unavoidably be injurious, to put the Blood into two ſuch
contrary Motions at once, as in Bleeding and Sleeping; in the Firſt of which
it is brought from the Center to the Circumference, and in the latter, from the
Circumference to the Center of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The Second Objection is, That this
concentration of the Blood in the time of Sleeping, fruſtrates the effect of
the Evacuation, which is the Principal Intention of Bleeding. Others without
aſſigning ſo many ridiculous Reaſons, only pretend if the Patient be
permitted to ſleep, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by ſome Motion of it, the Bandage of
the Arm may be looſned, and others are ſo poſitive, as to affirm they
have found Perſons ſleeping after Bleeding, actually dead. For my part,
none of theſe Reaſons prevail with me, or hinder my believing, ſleep
after bleeding very wholſom, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cooling the Body more effectually,
(which is one of <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42110:76"/>the principal ends of Bleeding) or
calming the Blood more, after the diſorder it is put into by the Evacuation.
Bleeding is a proper Remedy in want of ſleep; and after bleeding, moſt Men
find a greater deſire of ſleeping, than at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, without any
inconvenience attending it. As for the danger of loſing Blood in ſuch
Perſons as have unquiet and diſturbed Sleeps, they may be well enough
ſecured by a cloſe, well-made, double, Bandage, or by placing ſome
Servant by the Patient, to obſerve all his Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>It is commendable, to refrain from eating immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Bleeding, or till ſuch time as the Blood and Spirits have reſumed their
ordinary Courſe, which is a little irregular at that time; becauſe all the
Fermentations conducing to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, operate better in their Natural State;
than when they are put in any commotion. The ordinary time of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after
bleeding, is the ſpace of an Hour, except the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be very weak, in which
caſe he may take ſome Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives immediately, as a little Wine, or
ſome other Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquors. The Nouriſhment after Bleeding ought to be
light, and eaſie of Digeſtion, as ſome good Strengthning Broath.</p>
                     <p>The Porringers muſt be ſet in ſome place where there
is no Smoak, Wind, or Duſt, or where the Rays of the Sun do not beat,
becauſe all theſe Accidents change the Surface of the Blood, and hinder the
right judging of it. Veſſels of Silver, Pewter or Glaſs, are more proper
to keep the Blood in, than Braſs or Copper. The Veſſels muſt be
waſhed, and wiped clean, becauſe a little Moiſture remaining, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts to
the Blood a more florid Vermilion Colour.</p>

                     <head>Obſervations on the Blood in Porringers.</head>
                     <p>Since moſt Patients are Sollicitous about the State of
their Health, they are generally inquiſitive concerning their Blood, and
frequently asking the Surgeons Opinion of its Colour, Conſiſtence and
Taſt.</p>
                     <p>The Blood is a Heterogeneous Liquor, compos'd of a Multitude
of Particles, ſupplying proper Materials for the Reparation of the Body,
which is in a conſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The differing Particles, have each a
different Configuration, and Diſpoſition of Surface, which make a various
Reflection of the Light. Now that viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance called Colour, being
nothing elſe but the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <pb n="124" facs="tcp:42110:77"/>which the Rays of
Light returned after a various manner make on the bottom of the Eye, it is
conſequently true, the leaſt alteration in the Diſpoſition of the parts
of a Body, muſt produce an Alteration in its Colour. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted, no
reaſonable Man will deny the Colour of the Blood in a State of Health, to be
the undoubted Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and all others to be judg'd better or worſe, as they
approach to, or recede from it; and thoſe Colours allowed to ſhew the
moſt Vitious Diſpoſition of the Blood, which are moſt diſtant from
the Natural.</p>
                     <p>Blood then is pronounced good, and of a Natural Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
when it is Florid and Vermilion, which Colour it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in paſſing
through the Lungs, as Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Experiments has
Demonſtrated. Whoever obſerves, that the Blood drawn out of the <hi>Vena
Cava,</hi> before it enters the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and that drawn
out of the Pulmonary Artery, is of a dark, brown, Red; and on the contrary,
that drawn out of the Pulmonary Vein is of a Bright Red, and that drawn out of
the Artery of no better a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, after having paſt through the left
Ventricle, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conclude this effect proceeds from the
Nitre, diffus'd through the Maſs of Air, which is inceſſantly drawn into
the Lungs in Reſpiration, and ſo communicates its bright and lively
Tincture. This Operation is ſtill farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the following
Experiment. If Blood ſtands for ſome time in a Porringer, the Surface will
be of a Florid Colour, but the bottom of a Dark red; but if the
<hi>Coagulum</hi> be inverted, and the lower ſide for ſome time expoſed
to the Air, it becomes of as bright a Red, as its Surface before was. Which
effect, undoubtedly proceeds from the Saline parts of the Air, which
inſinuate themſelves, change the Diſpoſition of the Parts of the Blood,
and ſo cauſe them to reflect the Rays of Light, after a different
manner.</p>
                     <p>There is ground to pronounce the Blood bad, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
Blue, Whitiſh, Yellowiſh, or of very different Colours at once. The Ancient
Phyſicians pretended from the Colour of the Blood, to determine which of the
four Humours, Choler, Phlegm, Melancholy, or Blood taken in a ſtrict Sence
(which they thought to be the Ingredients of the Maſs) were predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant.
Chymical Phyſicians derive the various colours of the Maſs of Blood, from
the ſeveral Exaltations of the Active or Paſſive Principles, which they
believe to exiſt in the Blood. They aſcribe the Sound and Healthy State of
the Blood, and its laudable Colour, to the equal Mixture of its 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42110:77"/>Spirits, Salt, Sulphur, Water and Earth, and its
Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the effort in theſe Principles, to diſingage and
ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves from each other.</p>
                     <p>It is a Problem among the Learned, why the Blood in
Malignant Fevers, ſhould appear of ſo fine a Colour. This noble Colour is
reputed an ill Sign; Becauſe (ſay ſome Authors) the corrupted Blood is
deſtitute of Spirits, moves with difficulty through the Arteries next the
Heart, and ſcarcely arrives at the Extreme Parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>If it be askt whether a Florid Vermillion Blood be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
good, the Anſwer ought to be, this depends very much on the Colour. Orifice
of the Vein, the Manner of its iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing out, and the Veſſel which
receives it. An Orifice too great or too ſmall, are both faults in Bleeding,
and make the Blood appear different from what it would be, if the Orifice were
proportioned to the Veſſel. If it be too little, the Blood ſpins out in a
thin Thread, and is a long time in diſcharging it ſelf, and its Particles
are much more changed by the Air, than when it comes forth in a larger Stream,
and leſs Time: On the contrary, if the Aperture of the Veſſel be large,
inſtead of ſpringing out, it runs down the Arm, and the Surface is larger,
which likewiſe gives room for the Air to act on it, and create a lively red
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Again, if the Aperture of the Veſſel be too great or too ſmall,
and by this means the Blood muſt cake and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate too ſoon, and the
different parts have no time to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and riſe to the Surface which
appears Red, from the impreſſion of the Nitre of the Air, which gives it a
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition proper to excite ſuch a lively Senſation in our Eye.</p>
                     <p>The Veſſel which receives it, contributes very much to
the Colour, for if it be wide and ſhallow, it appears of a brighter Red, than
if the Veſſel be deep and narrow; in the firſt it ſoon coagulates and
cools, and leaves a greater Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face expoſed to be impregnated with the
Aerial Nitre, the contrary happens, when it is received in narrow and deep
Veſſels, in which it preſerves its Motion and Heat for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time,
which gives its Parts liberty to ſeparate, and riſe towards the Surface,
where they ſhew their proper Colour. If the Blood be much ſtirred, the Air
acts on more of its Parts, and it cools ſoon, which makes it appear more red.
Laſtly, if the Porringer or Veſſel which receives the Blood, have any
Water left in it, with which it was waſhed, it cools ſoon, and its Motion
ceaſing, there is not time for the <pb n="126" facs="tcp:42110:78"/>diverſity of its
parts to ſeparate, and riſe to the Top, for which reaſon its Colour is
finer. From theſe conſiderations it appears evidently enough, the Florid
Red is not a certain ſign of good Blood, ſince this Beautiful Colour may be
the effect of the different manner of letting out, or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Noble
Liquor. On the other Hand, the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is not a ſufficient Reaſon to
condemn the Operation, as ill performed; ſince the Blood ought to appear good
in a State of Health, or Slight Indiſpoſition, where there is no
Diſtemper ſufficient to communicate an ill Colour to the Maſs. In
Perſons reduced to extreme Weakneſs, or after long Abſtinence, or when
the fear of Bleeding, and the Terrour upon ſight of the Blood creates a
depreſſion of the Spirits, in theſe Caſes the Blood is of a Beautiful
Colour, becauſe the Spirits wanting force to project it to a diſtance, the
Air has more power over it to impregnate it with its Salts; And for the ſame
Reaſon, it ever has a Beautiful Colour in Malignant Fevers. On the other
Hand, the bad Colour of the Blood is not always an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Operation is
well performed; becauſe in ſome Bodies the Blood is ſo corrupt, that it
will appear bad, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it be ill let out, or ill received; In
fine, a Right Judgment can only be performed from the duely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all
Circumſtances before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Great Regard is to be had to the Conſiſtence of the
Blood when it is cold, and has ſtood for ſome time in the Veſſel, and
Obſervations of this kind will inform us, of its good or ill Condition. If
the Blood preſerves its Liquidity after it is perfectly cold, it do's plainly
diſcover its corruption, and the entire ſeparation of its Principles; on
the contrary, if the Blood Coagulates ſoon, it is a Mark of its Thickneſs,
and a Deficiency of Spirits: for which reaſon it is deprived of its
neceſſary Motion in the Veſſels. The due conſiſtence of cold Blood,
is ſuch as may preſerve a Moderate Union of its parts.</p>
                     <p>The Blood has rarely any Scent, unleſs it be entirely
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, its parts ſeparated, or it Stagnates in the Veins, and wants
Agitation, as in Leprous Perſons, or is vitiated by the Remains of an Old
Pox, in which caſes it ſometimes has an ill ſmell. Where the Blood is
thus Tainted, the Patient can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect long Life. But in this place I think
it pertinent, to give the Surgeon this neceſſary notice, That however the
Blood may be free from any ill ſmell, it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to draw in its
Steams in Reſpiration, and conſtant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <pb n="127" facs="tcp:42110:78"/>ſhews us, that Surgeons in Hoſpitals who bleed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, are more
frequently attacked with Malignant Fevers, than thoſe who dreſs Ulcers
which exhale the moſt foetid ſmell. From which Obſervation it evidently
follows, that in Breathing through the Mouth or Noſe the Poyſon is
received, which after circulates with the Blood, and infects the whole Maſs.
To taſt the Blood is both dangerous and diſguſtful, and therefore very
little information can be gained from this Head of its good or ill qualities;
However the ſweet Taſt is reputed beſt, and any other as Salt, Bitter, or
Acid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd as a Mark of its Depravation.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Subject, thoſe who pretend to know the
Patients Diſtemper by his Blood, are Impoſtors; there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſufficient ground to pronounce a Man to be indiſpoſed when the Blood has
a bad appearance, but to aſſign the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and its Nature, is an
impoſſible Matter.</p>

who never regard what they talk, and the Envy of his Fellow-Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who are
ever buſie in defaming one another. A young Surgeon therefore in point of
Prudence ought to be well inſtructed in the Accidents which happen after
Bleeding, and as well verſed in the Method of curing them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent having
recourſe to his Treacherous Friends.</p>
                     <p>The Principal Accidents in Bleeding are theſe which
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. In the firſt place it ſometimes happens the Vein is not prickt at
all, or at leaſt very ill opened, and the Blood comes out with difficulty.
The miſſing of a Vein proceeds either from its unſteadineſs when it is
not fixed enough under the Skin, to abide the Lancet, or from ſome
extraordinary Concern and Apprehenſion in the Artiſt, who when it lies deep
is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of having ſome Membrane, Nerve, Tendon, Artery, or other dangerous
part, or laſtly, ſome Deception of the ſenſe, when he believes he feels
a Vein in a place where there is none. A Vein is ſaid to be ill opened, when
the Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is either too High, or too Low, or when the Surgeon do's not
keep a rolling Vein ſteddy, for in this caſe the Vein ſlipping under the
Skin, the outward Orifice does not anſwer to the inward, and the Blood is
ſtopt. A Vein is likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42110:79"/>to be ill opened,
if the Orifice be too ſmall; but whether this be a fault or not, is not yet
decided, and it remains a controverſie amongſt the Learned, whether a
ſmall or a large Orifice be beſt. I ſhall not pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this
point, only here it concerns the young Artiſt to obſerve, that if the
Orifice be too large the Blood will not ſpring out and make an Arch, and the
Patient by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence will never be well contented.</p>
                     <p>If the Surgeon fail in his firſt attempt to open the Vein,
becauſe it flies from his Lancet; He muſt ſubject it again directly on
the Inciſion firſt made, and endeavour to prick it in the ſame Orifice,
or if he like not that, in ſome other place above or below, or in any other
Vein which preſents it ſelf fairer; but whatever he do's, he muſt be
ſure to have a preſence of Mind, without diſcovering the leaſt Fear or
Surprize, and not like ſome timorous Men appear out of Countenance upon
miſſing Bleeding, which alarms the Patient and Standers by, and makes them
think this, which is a very ſlight or no fault at all, a very great one. If
the Surgeon miſſes the Vein, and do's not make his Inciſion deep enough,
he may plunge his Lancet deeper in the ſame Vein, or make attempt to open it
in another place, with better Succeſs. I think it better to do this in a new
place, than to prick again in the ſame, and this is leſs apt to diſguſt
the Patient, who feels a Pain ſtill remaining in the firſt Puncture. If the
Surgeon be deceived in feeling, he ought to examine the Patients Arm with
greater exactneſs, to diſcover the place where the Vein lies, and if after
feeling and ſearching for a conſiderable time, he cannot find any greater
certainty than at firſt, it is better to defer Bleeding till the Evening or
the next Morning; becauſe the poſition of the Veins may ſhift in that
time, and all who have any Experience in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, know very well they are
ſometimes obliged to quit their work, and yet ſometime after Bleed in the
ſame place, with the greateſt eaſe imaginable. If a Vein be ill opened,
and the Blood comes ſo badly from it that the Patient cannot hope to be
relieved by it, the Surgeon muſt Bleed in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arm, or defer the
Operation, if the Nature of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper require it to be done in the
ſame, eſpecially if the Vein lies deep, becauſe theſe once beginning to
evacuate, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver riſe after, not to mention the Blood running down which
blinds the Operatour. If the Inciſion be too ſmall, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration ought to
be deferred till next day, or at leaſt the Patient ought to bleed on the
other ſide. If the Orifice be <pb n="129" facs="tcp:42110:79"/>too large, and the
Patients indiſpoſition be ſlight, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon may permit the Blood to
run down the Arm, but if the Diſeaſe be violent, and the Phyſician
pretend to judge of that by inſpecting the Blood, he muſt ſtreighten it a
little, the better to give the Blood its Natural Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes there happens to be a ſmall Collection of Blood
under the Skin, which forms a <hi>Thrombus,</hi> and after a little
Inflammation and Pain, ends in a ſlight Suppuration. The ſame conſequence
ſometimes happens upon a Lancet not being ſharp enough, for this makes a
ſort of Contuſion, and the edges of the Wound do not eaſily unite to each
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The extention of the Arm or other Motion of the Patient after Bleeding,
ſometimes impedes the Coalition, and ſome little quantity of Blood getting
between the Lips of the Orifice, forms a ſmall Ulcer which proves
troubleſom to the Patient for ſome time. The Method of preventing theſe
inconveniences, is firſt applying mild Digeſtive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and after them
Deſiccatives; for inſtance, uſing a warm Liniment with <hi>Oyl of Roſes
and Vinegar,</hi> laying a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Baſilicon</hi> on the Orifice, and
over that <hi>Galen's Cerate,</hi> or Rags ſeveral times doubled dipt in
<hi>Oxycrate</hi> a little heated, and after the Inflammation is over, and the
Suppuration compleated, a ſmall Emplaſter of burnt <hi>Ceruſe,
Diapalma,</hi> and <hi>de Minio</hi> to dry the Ulcer, and confirm the
<hi>Cicatrix.</hi> Sometimes there is an Appearance of a Contuſion on the
Arm, in Perſons who are nice and difficult to Bleed, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds-from
more than ordinary handling the part in feeling for the Veſſel, or a
ſmall Suffuſion of Blood under the Skin, but this accident is not attended
with Pain, and eaſily removed by chafing the Part well with <hi>Spirit of
Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Bleeding, the Membrane inveſting the Muſcles
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens to be hurt with the point of the Lancet, which Accident is
ever attended with Miſchievous conſequences, ſuch as a Fever, a very
great Inflammation, which in a very little time extends over all the inner
ſide of the Arm, a hard Swelling which ariſes on the place of the Puncture,
and terminates in a great Abſceſs, (and ſometimes more than one) between
the upper part of the Arm, and the Extremity of the Hand. This Accident is ever
worſt, when it happens in Hoſpitals of Great Cities, or Camps, where the
Air is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or in foul Bodies, or ſuch as are over-heated by Fatigue,
or Diſorderly living. Sometimes theſe Symptoms are not ſo violent, and
the Patient only feels a conſiderable <pb n="130" facs="tcp:42110:80"/>Pain from the
place quite down to the Thumb, on the ſame ſide, which incommodes him
moſt in turning the Wriſt round. This Symptom proceeds from a Hurt of the
Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous <hi>Faſcia,</hi> aſſiſting in this Motion, and this remains
for a long time. This Accident is ſoon perceived by a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pain in the
inſtant of Pricking, extending from the Place to the Thumb, where the Tendon
terminates. The ill Conſequences which attend it are prevented in great
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by Defenſatives, as by unction of the Part with <hi>Oyl of
Roſes</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or the ſame beat up with the <hi>White of
an Egg, Bole Armoniack, Galen's Cerate,</hi> and repeated Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the
other Arm. When the Pain, Inflammation and Swelling encreaſe, it is proper to
uſe an Anodyne Cataplaſm made of <hi>Milk, Crumbs of Bread, Saffron,
Populeum,</hi> and <hi>Oyl of Roſes,</hi> and attempt to break the
Suppuration on the Orifice by ſome proper Application to the Part, as
<hi>Emplaſt. Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Diachylon</hi> with the Gums, or a Cataplaſm made
with <hi>Sorrel, Lily Roots,</hi> and <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> or Rags dipt in
warm <hi>Oxycrate.</hi> If an Abſceſs happen in any other part beſides
the Orifice, it is to be opened where the included <hi>Pus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it
ſelf, and treated in the ordinary Method.</p>
                     <p>If none of theſe Accidents happen after the Puncture, and
the Patient only complains of a Pain extending from the Orifice to the Wriſt,
without any fear of Inflammation or Suppuration, it ſuffices to uſe a
Liniment made of <hi>Oyl of Roſes</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> mixed,
heated and repeated thrice a day, and after if occaſion require, <hi>Oyl of
Earth-Worms,</hi> with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> or <hi>Queen of Hungaries
Water,</hi> or rub well the whole Arm with <hi>Oyntment of
Marſhmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguen. Martiatum</hi> melted. During the Cure,
the Prudent Surgeon ought to viſit him ſeveral times a day, and perfect it
with all poſſible ſpeed, to ſecure his Friendſhip, and prevent his
being offended at the Accident.</p>

                     <head>Of an Eriſipelas after Bleeding.</head>
                     <p>The Surgeon is not always blameable, when an
<hi>Eriſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> ariſes after Bleeding, for however the Puncture of the
Muſcular Membrane, or ſome Nerve or Tendon, may cauſe the effuſion of a
Hot, Bilious Blood the common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of an <hi>Eriſipelas;</hi> yet it is
no leſs certain, the ſame effect ſucceeds ſometimes on the opening
Veins which are ſo very large, that the moſt unskillful Surgeon cannot hurt
any other Part, or fear the leaſt Accident. In ſuch Caſes 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42110:80"/>the Cauſe of the <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> is to be
aſcribed to the ill Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Patients Blood, which upon
opening the Veſſel is conveyed thither by the Arteries with great
impetuoſity, and in greater quantity, than can conveniently return by the
Veins. This Conjecture is confirmed, by obſerving that at the ſame time
this boyling impetuous Blood cauſes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Inflammation, and very
great Tenſion of the Arm, it has the like effect on the Lungs, and cauſes
great Difficulty of breathing, Spitting of Blood, and all Symptoms of a
Peripneumony, which ordinarily proves fatal after the <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> is
vaniſhed: Add to this, the Inflammation is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily leſs near the
Orifice, than in more diſtant Parts.</p>
                     <p>THE SIGNS of an <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> are manifeſt enough,
<hi>viz.</hi> a large viſible Swelling of the Arm, extending from the
Shoulder to the Hand, with a Train continuing from the Arm-pit to the Elbow,
the Skin appears Red and Inflamed, which is ſometimes greater in one place,
and ſometimes in another. A continual Fever is kindled, the Patient feels a
great pain with Tenſion and Burning, which will not ſuffer him to reſt; a
Difficulty of Breathing enſues, the Spit turns red, and there is a
ſenſible heat in every part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>THE CURE. Bleeding on the oppoſite Side is very
Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in remedying theſe Miſchievous Accidents, eſpecially if
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſeven or eight times ſoon after one another (to make a prompt and
effectual Diverſion) in conjunction with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal Medicines, to
abate the Fervour of the Blood. The Patient muſt be confined to a ſtrict
regular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, to Cool, Purifie and ſupply a competent ſtock of Moiſture
to the Maſs; ſuch as <hi>Veal</hi> or <hi>Chicken Broths,</hi> with Leaves
of <hi>Succory, Lettuces, Chervil, Borage, Bugloſs,</hi> and a little Gelly,
but not too Nouriſhing. The Patient may drink Ptiſans with Roots of
<hi>Scorzonera, Marſh-mallows, Nenuphar, Dogs graſs, Liquorice,</hi> and
every Night two Doſes of an Apozem, with cold Seeds boyl'd in it, adding
ſome good <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup</hi> and <hi>Diacodium</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ℥i.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> ſpread much and extend to the
Breaſt, it is very proper to give powder of Vipers in the firſt Draught of
Broth, or in ſome Cordial Water, as <hi>Scabious, Scordium, Carduus,
Scorzonera</hi> or <hi>Wood-ſorrel</hi> to abate its Violence, and fortifie
the parts againſt the ill effects of the Malignant Bile, which infects all
the Humours of the Body. The Diſeaſed Part muſt be fomented with a
Decoction of Roots of <hi>Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows,</hi> Leaves of <hi>Marſhmallows,
Violary, Pellitory of the <pb n="132" facs="tcp:42110:81"/>Wall, Groundſil, Betes,
Herb-Mercury,</hi> adding after Boyling a little <hi>Vinegar</hi> of Roſes,
and ſo uſing it thrice or four times a Day, ſoaking Stupes in the
Decoction, and applying them hot on the part, which ought to be rubbed
likewiſe with a Liniment made of the Juices of <hi>Nightſhade,
Plantain</hi> and <hi>Houſleek,</hi> the Mucilage of the Seeds of
<hi>Pſyllium, Linſeed</hi> and <hi>Fenugreek</hi> drawn in
<hi>Roſe-water,</hi> Oyl of <hi>Poppies, Camphire, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron</hi> and the

                     </p>
                     <p>If the Pain and Inflammation are moderate, a Diſcutient or
Reſolvent Cataplaſm may be applyed, made of Meal of <hi>Wild Vetches,

<hi>Flowers of Roſes, Chamomil, Melilot,</hi> together with <hi>Oyl of
Dill,</hi> and St. <hi>Johns wort.</hi> If the Eriſipelatous Swelling
Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerates in any part of the Arm, a Detergent lotion is proper, of
<hi>Birthwort, Periwinkle, leſſer Centaury, Gentian, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
Sanicle,</hi> uſing after this, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. Nutritum, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholyx,
Deſiccativum rubrum, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent</hi> of <hi>Ceruſs,</hi> the Santaline
Cerate, or other drying Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſs the moſt dangerous Accident which happens in
Bleeding, is the pricking a Nerve or Tendon, whoſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Method of
Cure are very much alike. The Nerves of the Arm lie ſo deep, it ſeldom
happens they are pricked, but it falls out too often in opening the <hi>Vena
Mediana,</hi> that the Tendon of the <hi>Biceps</hi> Muſcle (which together
with the internal Brachial bends the Cubit) is hurt, becauſe this Vein moſt
commonly runs over, or at leaſt very near it. If the Nerve or Tendon be hurt,
it is ſoon diſcovered by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent pain, which the Patient feels at the
time of the Puncture, as well as by the enſuing ſwelling in the Arm, which
is very large, attended with ſtrong pulſation, great Inflammation, a
continual Fever, and without ſpeedy care to prevent them, Convulſions,
<hi>Delirium,</hi> a Gangrene and Mortification of the Part, which cruel
Accidents kill the Patient in a ſmall time.</p>
                     <p>The Prevention of theſe Accidents is attempted by
bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the ſame Regimen which is preſcribed in the
<hi>Eriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas</hi> of the Arm, together with Ptiſans, Cooling Draughts,
Laxative Clyſters and Apozems. The Surgeon muſt have an eſpecial care in
treating the Wounded Part; to apply to the adjacent parts as well above as
below, good Defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives made of <hi>Oyl of Roſes, Whites of Eggs, Bole
Armoniack, <pb n="133" facs="tcp:42110:81"/>Juices of</hi> Solanum, <hi>Houſleek,
Vinegar, Oxycrate</hi> made with Waters of <hi>Plantain, Mulberries, Roſes,
Henbane-ſeed,</hi> and a greater proportion of the ſharpeſt
<hi>Vinegar,</hi> than is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in the Compoſition. Ancient Writers
direct the pouring in hot Oyls, to abſorb the Moiſture iſſuing from the
Wounded Nerve. This Gleet, unleſs prevented, ſoon turns ſharp and
acrimonious, and acquires an exceeding Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality, <hi>Guido de
Cauliaco,</hi> calls it a Nitrous and Aeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous <hi>Sanies,</hi> and commends
Oyl of <hi>Savin</hi> preferably to all others. In Defect of this <hi>Oyl of
Turpentine,</hi> with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> may
ſerve, or <hi>Oyl of</hi> St. <hi>Johns wort, Lilies, Foxes, Caſtor,</hi>
Euphorbium, or <hi>Oyl of Eggs,</hi> if the Pain be exceſſive; Laſtly, in
want of all theſe. <hi>Oyl of Dill</hi> or <hi>Rue,</hi> made by the Decoct
on the Ingredients in common Oyl.</p>
                     <p>The whole Arm is to be rubbed for a long time together with
<hi>Oyl of Roſes, Camomil</hi> or <hi>Lillies,</hi> or pretty ſharp
<hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> Theſe Oyls are to be applyed very hot, and the whole Arm
covered with the Cataplaſms preſcribed above in Eriſipelatous Tumours, or
Emplaſtrum <hi>Diachalciteos</hi> or <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> diſſolved in
<hi>Oyl of Roſes</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollient and Diſcutient
Fomentations, with a little <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If theſe Remedies fail of the intended effect, the Surgeon
muſt dilate the Wound to give the included Sanies (which is lodged on the
Nerve or Tendon) a free diſcharge, and open a way for the more effectual
applying Medicines to its bottom. This Method is uſed by the beſt
Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Guido de Cauliaco,</hi> who in
treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wounds of the Nerves and Tendons, directs a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in theſe
caſes principally to aim at, diſcharging the virulent Sanies, by making an
inciſion through the Tegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and laying the bottom open. <hi>Ambroſe
Parry</hi> gives the ſame advice, and indeed all who underſtand the Nature
of theſe Wounds, know it is by no means convenient to defer the laying them
open, and diſcharging the acrimonious Matter pent up, nor is this ever done
ſo Succeſsfully after ſome time, as in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>When the Wound is ſufficiently dilated upwards and
downwards, with an Inciſion Knife or crooked Sciſſars, (and made rather
too great than too ſmall) good Digeſtives muſt be put in it, as Liniment
of <hi>Arcaeus</hi> melted pretty hot, or a Digeſtive Unguent of
<hi>Turpentine</hi> waſhed in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> Powder of <hi>Myrrh,
Oyl of Eggs,</hi> and <hi>Gum Elemi,</hi> and the <pb n="134" facs="tcp:42110:82"/>Wound
filled up with Pledgits (without forcing any in) and the ſame Oyntments,
Cataplaſms, Emplaſters and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations continued on the Tumefied part as
before, till a good Suppuration is procured and all Accidents ceaſe, and then
it muſt be incarn'd, dryed and cicatrized after the uſual manner.</p>
                     <p>In theſe caſes a Prudent Surgeon will conceal his Fault
to preſerve his Fame; but if he finds the Patient is like to run any Riſque
of his Life, or there be the leaſt hazard in the Caſe, he muſt Sacrifice
his Reputation to the Patients Health, and by this means make him ſome ſort
of Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inſtantly lay open the Wound, if there be the leaſt
danger in deferring it. If the Apertion has been too long procraſtinated, and
the Tenſion, Fever and Convulſion do continue, and the Natural Heat of the
Part is extinguiſhed, which is diſcovered by the Riſing of the
<hi>Veſiculae</hi> or little Bladders, the change of the Red into a Dark
colour, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Livid, by the decaying and withering, and weight of the
Part, and by a certain putrid Cadaverous Stench ſoon diſcernible in
approaching the Patient. There is no time to be loſt, and the Surgeon muſt
uſe all his endeavours to take off the Convulſion, abate the Tenſion,
recall the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat, and prevent the entire Mortification of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Part.</p>
                     <p>To prevent the Convulſion, Authors adviſe the cutting
the Tendon or Nerve aſunder, whoſe Fibres are apt to be torn by the
contraction of the Muſcle. But ſometimes even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cutting the Tendon
aſunder, the Convulſion does not ceaſe. To abate the Tenſion, the
ſwelling is to be Scarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the quick, throughout its whole Extent,
eſpecially in thoſe places where it is Veſicated, or the Scarf-skin
ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or the Skin diſcoloured. That the Scarification is deep enough,
may be known from the Patients crying out, and Blood iſſuing from the
Orifice. The Scarification muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin beneath, and be continued up to the
higheſt part of the Swelling in ſuch a manner, that the lower Angles of the
upper Inciſion may interſect the upper Angles of the lower, and the Skin by
conſequence ſuffer no conſtraint.</p>
                     <p>The Scarifications may be multiplied according as the
Diſeaſe encreaſes, and made longer and deeper if the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene do's not
ſtop, in order to apply Medicines to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the putrefied Slough. All
Medicines are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed very hot to reſtore the Natural Heat, and ſtir
up the remaining Spirits to a Vigorous Action. Fomentations may 
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42110:82"/>be made with <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> diſſolved in
<hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> ſtrengthned with <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack,</hi>
or the yellow Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made with <hi>Quicklime,</hi> and <hi>Sublimate
corroſive.</hi> A Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation made with a good quantity of <hi>Common
Salt</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in very ſtrong <hi>Vinegar,</hi> with the addition
of <hi>Spirit of Wine, Honey of Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> is a
good Medicine if applied hot to warm the Scarified part. Thoſe who have
Experience, may compoſe variety of theſe Applications ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their
Opinion of their Virtue, and dip Pledgits in them to put in the Inciſion,
taking care to lay on ſome good Liniment to procure a laudable Suppuration,
and a quick Separation of the gangrened and corrupted part.</p>
                     <p>This Liniment may be made of <hi>Turpentine</hi> waſhed in
<hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine,</hi> with Powders of <hi>Myrrh, Aloes, Aegyptiacum,
Baſilicon, Oyl of Wormwood, and</hi> St. <hi>Johns wort.</hi> After the
inciſions are filled with theſe and other like Medicines, it is convenient
to apply on the part ſome Cataplaſm, to put a ſtop to the progreſs of
the putrefaction, to diſcuſs, dry, and abate Pain. This Cataplaſm may
conſiſt of <hi>Meal of Beans, Barley, Wild Vetches, Lupins,</hi> boyl'd in
<hi>Oxymel</hi> with <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt, Honey of Roſes, Juice of
Wormwood,</hi> and <hi>Hore-hound,</hi> Powders of <hi>Myrrh, Aloes</hi> and
<hi>Maſtich,</hi> with a little <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> added at laſt, to
give the whole a ſoft Conſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Cataplaſms are very good on theſe occaſions, tho'
ſome Practitioners condemn them, upon a pretence they load the Part, ſtop
the Pores, and hinder Tranſpiration; for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they prefer
Compreſſes dipt in ſome of the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Liquors, with ſome
Aromatick <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> with Bottles of hot Water, Bricks and Tiles
applyed to the part to preſerve the Warmth. Theſe Bricks and Tiles are to
be wrapt in Linen Cloth ſeveral times doubled, to prevent burning the
Patient. This is the more neceſſary, becauſe the Parts being in a manner
inſenſible, will endure very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable burning before the Patient
complain of it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Applications muſt be renewed twice or thrice a

violent Pains in the Head, in the Fits of an Epilepſy for a long time, he
bled him in the Frontal Vein, upon which the Patient loſt the uſe of one of
his Eyes, which remained ſhut. The pain of his Head ſometime after grew

with Child, cauſed her ſelf to be bled in both Feet at the ſame time, in
hopes of obtaining an eaſie Delivery, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after theſe bleedings,
ſhe found her ſelf in a very great diſorder, the Throes which attended
Women in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour came upon her, and that Night ſhe was delivered of a dead

the ſame Obſervation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Hiſtory of a certain Man, who
cauſed himſelf to be bled twice, one time immediately after the other in
both Arms, to relieve him in a Laſſitude, and Heavineſs of the Head.
About three Hours after Bleeding, he found a great weight on the <hi>Anus,</hi>
and a vehement Pain which was greater the following Night, and attempting to
walk the next Day, the Pain, Inflammation and Weight encreaſed, ſtill being

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Operation of the
<hi>Aneuriſm.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>an Inciſion of the Teguments to lay the
Artery bare, and make a Ligature on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. There are two kinds of Aneuriſm, <hi>the
Genuine</hi> and <hi>Spurious.</hi> The <hi>Spurious</hi> Aneuriſm is only
the caſual opening an Artery by the point of the Lancet, joyn'd with a loſs
of Blood iſſuing from the opened Veſſel. The <hi>Genuine</hi>
Aneuriſm is a Collection of Arterial Blood, which forms a Swelling within the
Artery it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Genuine Aneuriſm proceeds ſometimes from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
and ſometimes from an external Cauſe. The internal Cauſe of a true
Aneuriſm, is the Action of ſome ſharp and corroſive Humour, which
finding a way to get out of the Glands, fixes on the external Tunick of the
Arteries, and corrodes and conſumes it. The internal Tunick in the mean time
is exceedingly dilated, and diſtended by the conſtant repeated impulſe of
the Blood, and the Fibres of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wanting ſtrength to reſiſt
their effort of extruſion, they at length break forth, and form this
Aneuriſmal Tumour. All parts of the Body are ſubject to Swellings of this
kind, which are more frequent in decay'd emaciated Subjects where the Blood is
more Saline, than in corpulent fat People.</p>
               <p>The external Cauſe is ſome Accidental Punction of the outer
Coat of the Artery, with a Lancet or ſome ſuch like Inſtrument, or ſome
Fall or Blow received, or perhaps ſome more than ordinary ſtraining the
Voice, in crying or holding the Breath in Labour, any of which recited
Cauſes, are ſufficient to ſtrain or break the Fibres of the external
Coat, and the Blood continually ſtriking on the weakned place, produces an
Aneuriſm.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42110:84"/>
               <p>The Spurious Aneuriſm is cauſed by the opening of an Artery
which lets out the Blood, which after Extravaſation, lodges in the
Poroſities of the Fleſh and Skin, and there forms a Livid Tumour, or is
quite evacuated if the Teguments are entirely divided by the Lancet.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of a Genuine Aneuriſm, are an external Swelling,
with a ſenſible Pulſation, the Swelling is ſoft, and if preſt with
the Finger ſubſides inſtantly, returning when the preſſure is
removed. There is no diſcoloration of the Skin, becauſe the Tumour is
ſupported by the Blood circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating through the Arterial Channel.</p>
               <p>This Tumour ſometimes equals the bigneſs of a Cheſtnut,
and ſometimes an Egg. Theſe Swellings ſometimes break of themſelves,
and ſometimes the Patient carries them with him to his Grave without
burſting; becauſe the Artery growing Callous in the place where it was
moſt of all weakned, is by this enabled to ſuſtain the utmoſt ſhock
of the Blood. Theſe Calloſities like thoſe in <hi>Fiſtulas,</hi>
proceed from the moſt Saline and Pungent Particles of the Blood, which
lodging in the Pores of the Arterial Coats, mix with their Nutritious Juice,
and harden it. Sometimes they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Blood, which being in a
perpetual Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and paſſing through the Swelling, dries and
hardens it, by rarefying and waſting that Humidity which kept its Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks
wet. The Signs of a Spurious Aneuriſm, are the deep beating of the Artery,
the almoſt livid colour of the Skin, the Tumour not riſing ſo high as the
true poſſeſſing a greater ſpace, and not ſo eaſily yielding to
the Finger, as the true Aneuriſm, and when the Artery is opened, the Blood
coming out with impetuoſity and force.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>The Operation is performed in the ſame manner both in the
True and Spurious Aneuriſm, if preceding Methods prove ineffectual. Place the
Patient in a Chair, let a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hold the Arm extended, then lay a good
Compreſs round the Arm above the Swelling, and make a Ligature o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this,
which you may ſtreighten at pleaſure, by turning round a ſmall ſtick
called the Turniket or Turnſtick. The advantage in laying a compreſs under
the Ligature, is to make it leſs painful, more equal, and prevent pinching
the Skin. The Artery may be compreſſed to any degree requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by turning
round the Stick. When the Artery is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently compreſſed, take the
Patients Arm with your Hand <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42110:84"/>below the Swelling, and make
an Inciſion with a Lancet in the other Hand. This Inciſion muſt be made
lengthways, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of the Veſſel, beginning below and
end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above, and ought to be too large, rather than too little, to lay the
Artery bare. The Tumour being opened evacuate the coagulated Blood with the
Finger, and if there be any coherences, cut them with the crooked Sciſſars,
to clear the Wound from the concreted Blood, and of all other extraneous
Bodies, which ſometimes are found in Aneuriſms of long ſtanding. You
muſt looſen the Turniket from time to time, to diſcover the Orifice of
the Artery, and then ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it from the Membranes, which connect it to the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts; the Separation muſt be made with a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula, for fear of
cutting it with an Inciſion Knife. Then hold the Artery with a Hook, to free
it from its other Ties, and when it is clear, paſs a crooked Needle with a
waxed Thread under it, cut the Thread, and draw out the Needle. The point of
the Needle muſt be blunt, to avoid pricking the Part. After this make a
Ligature on the ſtrongeſt part of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; firſt with a ſimple
knot, and then place a Compreſs over that ſtrengthned with two other knots
on the Compreſs may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted if it ſhall be thought inconvenient. A like
Ligature muſt be made on the inferior part of the Orifice, to hinder the
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifications of the Arteries from diſcharging any Blood. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
intervening between the two Ligatures muſt be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, becauſe the two
ends of the Artery contracting and ſhrinking within the Skin, may thruſt
the Ligature off, which would be more dangerous than the Aneuriſm it ſelf,
ſince it would be difficult to find the ends, and tye them.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay on the Wound Doſſils arm'd with
Reſtringent Powders, an Emplaſter and a Compreſs. Lay a great ſquare
Compreſs the whole length of the Arm, following the Courſe of the Artery
quite from the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Arm-pit, and keep all on with a Bandage made
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>
                  <p>Take a Roller or Fillet of more than two inches broad, and an
Ell and half or two Ells in length (more or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bigneſs
of the Subject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>apply one
end beneath the Elbow, making two rounds about the Arm, then aſcending
Spirally (ſo as to leave one third part of the neather Roller bare in each
Turn) in paſſing over the Tumour compreſs it a little by ſtreightning
the Roller, and continue to aſcend in the ſame manner to the Arm-pit then
turn it round the Breaſt, and faſten it with Pins. The Emplaſter and
Compreſs muſt <pb n="140" facs="tcp:42110:85"/>be about three or four inches broad,
long enough to go round the Arm, and be ſlit a pretty way at each end,
leaving a part plain and undivided in the midſt. This Figure is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to prevent wrinkles; The Bandage muſt be kept on three or four Days without
undoing it, and in the firſt Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you muſt be careful to take the
Pledgits very gently off.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Place the Patients Arm a little bended on a
Cuſhion, extending it now and then for fear it grow ſtiff. Dreſs the
Wound conſtantly at leaſt once a Day, continuing the uſe of Reſtringent
Powders, as <hi>Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Bole Armoniack, Colophonia, Dragons Blood,
Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> and <hi>Laudanum.</hi> After you are once ſecure, the
Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels will not re-open, Suppurate the Wound with ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive,
made with <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Yelks of Eggs,</hi> and after a laudable
Digeſtion obtained, deterge it well, and Cicatrize it. The Patient at firſt
muſt be allowed only ſome few Liquids, for fear any Putrefaction ariſe
from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, and the uſe of ſolid Aliments, and their Wound muſt be
treated according to the uſual method of Practice.</p>
                  <p>The Marks or Signs by which it is known that the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is
hurt, is the Reſiſtance againſt the point of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, the elevation
and violent beating communicated to the Vein by the Subjacent Artery, the
ſpringing out of the Blood by ſeveral diſtinct Jetts, as happens in a
wounded Artery; but with this difference, that it is not ſo lively
ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or florid, and is not projected to ſo great a diſtance. If any
of theſe unfortunate Accidents happen, and you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have the
Aneuriſm cured without Operation, bleed the Patient to abate the rapid Motion
of the Blood, and put a ſtop to the progreſs of the Tumour, apply on the
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery a ſmall Compreſs with half a Bean wrapt up in it, lay over this
another Compreſs ſomething larger, and then over that more ſtill
gradually encreaſing, to compreſs the part more equally; around the Wound
apply Defenſatives, and keep all on with the Bandage uſed in the
Aneuriſm, leaving on the Dreſſings as long as poſſible. When the
Patient begins to regain his Strength, you muſt bleed again, leaſt the
Veſſels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with Blood preſs on the weak part of the Artery, and
occaſion a Tumour.</p>
                  <p>In a Spurious or Baſtard Aneuriſm, the Blood is
extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated under the Teguments, and the moſt expeditious way to
anticipate the Lividity and Gangrening of the part and the uſual Accidents
attending theſe Caſes, is to proceed inſtantly to Operation. But if the
Patient will not endure this, apply Compreſſes and proper Diſcutients on
the part, and have Recourſe to frequent Bleeding.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42110:85"/>
                  <p>The external Aneuriſm is not near ſo Dangerous as the
internal, and it is often impoſſible to treat it, and even ſo much as to
diſcover it. The following Medicines are good in external Aneuriſms. ℞.
<hi>Powder of Sumach, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pociſtis, Acacia, Dragons Blood, Aloes,
Frankincenſe,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. <hi>Beat all with the White of an Egg, to the
conſiſtence of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter,</hi> let this be applyed to the part to
heal the Wound, which muſt be well cleanſed from all the Grumous Blood
lodged in it. A plate of Lead applyed alone, or beſmeared with the Juyce of
<hi>Plantain,</hi> and bound on ſtreight, puts a ſtop to the Growth, or
Cures an Aneuriſm quite, if applyed in the beginning. In theſe Palliative
Cures, the Patient is often obliged to carry this Plate about him all his
Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> cured after the following manner,
a large Aneuriſm equalling an Egg in bigneſs, hard and pale coloured, with
an exceeding great Pulſation, and hindring the Patient in the free
extenſion of his Arm. In the firſt place he ordered the Patient to
obſerve an exact <hi>Regimen,</hi> then applyed on the Swelling <hi>Emp. de

                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. <hi>Mix this for a purging
Potion;</hi> the next Morning returning to the former Julep again each day. He
renewed the Application of the <hi>Emplaſtr. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuta</hi> on the Tumour.
After this he gave him a Purgative <pb n="142" facs="tcp:42110:86"/>Potion made of the
remaining Moiety of the <hi>Infuſion of Sena and Rhubard, with the Addition
of Confectio Hamech,</hi>

℈ſs. <hi>Cinnamon Water,</hi> ℥ſs. This Potion he gave him
upon the third Day after the firſt Purge. He tells us this Purge wrought ſo
violently, and with that good Succeſs downwards, that the next Morning there
was no appearance of any Aneuriſm or Pulſation in the Part. Then he applyed
this Emplaſter, ℞. <hi>Empl. Diachalciteos</hi> ℥ij. <hi>Powder of

binding this ſtreight on to compreſs the Swelling, and the Aneuriſm was
cured.</p>
                  <p>There remains one neceſſary caution to be given the
Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour in this place, and that is, to extend the Patients Arm at times and

<hi>Cicatrix</hi> be formed, which retains it bent the whole time of his

certain Man of 50 Years of Age, of a very Melancholy complexion, who had a
large Tumour on the right Clavicle, about half the bigneſs of an Egg, of the
ſame colour with the Skin, with a very great Pulſation in it, which induced
him to think it an Aneuriſm. The Patient dying, he found the aſcending

                  <p>To regain the free Motion of the Arm after the preceding

<hi>or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated Blood lodg'd on the</hi> Dura Mater.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSES. Fractures of the <hi>Cranium</hi> or Skull, are the
moſt ordinary occaſions of performing this Operation. Theſe are of two
kinds, Inciſion or Cutting, made by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument with a ſharp edge, or
Contuſion by ſome blow with a blunt Inſtrument or Fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> enumerates five kinds of Fractures of the

               <p>There are three ſorts of Inciſion: In the firſt the Blow
is perpendicular, and the edge of the Inſtrument enters the Skull, and
without taking off any portion of it, makes an impreſſion only in it. This
by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <hi>Eccopè,</hi> by <hi>Hippocrates
Hedra,</hi> and by the Latin Writers, <hi>Veſtigium</hi> or <hi>Sedes,</hi>
and in <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be properly enough called an
<hi>Impreſſion.</hi> In the Second, the Blow is more oblique, and enters
deeper into the ſubſtance of the Bone; but ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any part
off, and this is termed <hi>Diacope.</hi> In the laſt kind, a piece of the
Skull is entirely cut off, and this is named <hi>Apokeparniſmos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contuſions are divided into two kinds; <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe
which do not, and thoſe which do deſtroy the Continuity of the Part.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is called by Hippocrates <hi>Thlaſis,</hi> and is
a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Depreſſion of the Bone, and not a real Fracture. This 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42110:87"/>happens in Children principally, whoſe Bones are pliant
and flexible, and eaſily give way without breaking, like Pewter Pots, or any
other Veſſels made of malleable Metals.</p>
               <p>The Second only, where there is a diviſion of the Bone, can in
a ſtrict ſence be termed a Fracture.</p>
               <p>When the Bone is divided, and the Surface notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
remains equal, the Fracture is named a Fiſſure. This if it be very
viſible is called <hi>Rogme,</hi> if ſcarce ſeen, or wholly
imperceptible, <hi>Trichiſmos</hi> or a Capillary Fiſſure.</p>
               <p>When the equality of the Bone is deſtroyed, as well as its
continuity, and ſome fragment of the <hi>Cranium</hi> diſplaced, the
Fracture by Hippocrates is called <hi>Eſphlaſis</hi> or
<hi>Euthlaſis,</hi> of which he reckons up three kinds: <hi>Ecpieſma</hi>
when the <hi>Cranium</hi> is depreſſed, and ſome Splinter of the Bone
ſticks in, or preſſes on the <hi>Dura Mater. Angiſoma,</hi> when there
is a Depreſſion, and the Fragment broken off lies under the entire Bone.
<hi>Camaroſis,</hi> when either one end of the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is depreſt, and
the other raiſed, or both ends are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and it riſes in the midſt,
leaving an Arch as it were vaulted over, from which this <hi>Species</hi>
derives its Name.</p>
               <p>In Infants, an Arch ſometimes happens to be made by a
Depreſſion of the Bone, without a Fiſſure, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by its
Elaſtick virtue, returns to its priſtin State; ſometimes the exterior
Table of the Skull alone, returns to its Natural State, and the inner remains
depreſt. Theſe Caſes can only happen in very young Children, while the
<hi>Cranium</hi> is Membranous before Oſſification is compleated, and is
not poſſible in Adults, whoſe Bones are dry and brittle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaking of a Contrafiſſure, pretends
it may happen after three ſeveral ways, <hi>viz.</hi> In the ſame Bone when
the upper part is ſtruck, and the lower broken; or the outer Table receives
the blow, and the inner ſubjacent Table is broken, or in different Bones, as
when the Occipital Bone is ſtruck, and the Fracture is in the Coronal.</p>
               <p>It is very improbable that a Contrafiſſure ſhould happen
in moſt ordinary Skulls, and any Perſon who conſiders that the ſeveral
parts of this Bone are not continuous, but a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of pieces ſeparated
by Sutures, muſt needs admit it to be very difficult, to ſuppoſe a
Fiſſure propagated from one to the other, and be convinced thoſe
Inſtances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by that Author, are not very much to be relyed on.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42110:87"/>
               <p>But I profeſs here I would not be underſtood to arraign the
Faith of that Great Man, or inſinuate a ſuſpicion of his deſign to
impoſe on Poſterity. That ſtrain of Integrity and Candour which runs
through every part of his Writings, is too viſible to charge him with a Crime
of this Nature. I make no doubt, thoſe Inſtances which he mentions, really
happened in the ſame manner as they are related; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, in
thoſe Perſons the <hi>Cranium</hi> was one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bone, as in ſome
Bodies it has been found to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preceptible Sutures in it.
Admitting this to be true, it is not difficult to conceive that the left
Parietal receiving a ſmart Blow, and yielding a little, may communicate the
Motion to the Right, and that be crak't, eſpecially if we ſuppoſe it to
be of unequal thickneſs, and weaker than the other.</p>
               <p>If Contrafiſſures happen in Skulls divided by Sutures, it is
rational to believe they proceed from ſome Fall, which the Perſon who
received the Blow, might happen to have had during the time he remained
Senſeleſs. Now the Wound making a viſible Diviſion of the Teguments,
without any Fracture of the Bone, and the Fall on the contrary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a
Fiſſure of the Bone without hurting the Teguments, it is very poſſible
the Surgeon not being informed of the Patients Fall, may impute this
Fiſſure to the firſt Blow. And thus it is very probable,
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> might be led into this Miſtake. Nor can it be thought
ſtrange, that a Fracture of the Skull ſhould be made, without a Wound of
the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, ſince every days Experience ſhews us, That Arms, Leggs, and
other Limbs are daily broken, without any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Skin.</p>
               <p>If it ever happen, as ſome Practitioners pretend, that the
lower Table of the Skull is broken, and the upper not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding remains
entire, this odd effect muſt be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after this manner. Between the two
Tables of the Skull, there is a viſible interſtice fill'd with Marrow, and
intertex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Bony Fibres, which middle Subſtance is very ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and
porous; now if it be true, as moſt undoubtedly it is, that there is no
<hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature, the Poroſities of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance muſt
conſequently be filled with ſome Matter or other; which admit to be the
Air; it will then follow, that when a Man receives a ſmart blow on the Head,
and the upper Table yields without breaking, the included Air is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and impetuouſly ſhocks the inner Table, which if it be
ſo compact and hard that it cannot obey, muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42110:88"/>crack. The ſame reaſon may be alledged, in favour of
thoſe who eſpouſe the Doctrine of Contrafiſſures.</p>
               <p>Matter may ſometimes be extravaſated on the
<hi>Meninges,</hi> though the upper Table of the Skull remain entire; for
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when the Marrow contained in the interſtice between the Plates,
by ſome Accident being corrupted and growing Acrimonious, corrodes and
cariates the lower Table, and ſo diſcharges it ſelf on the <hi>Dura
Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Fractures of the Skull are for the moſt part
viſible to the naked Eye, and a ſenſible Fiſſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the
Bone, when the Teguments are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>If no Fiſſure appear, and there is ground to ſuſpect
one, tho' it be ſo ſmall as to eſcape the ſight, the uſual practice
is to lay Ink on the Part, and after ſome little time to wipe it off, for
then if ſuch Fiſſure be, there will appear a black Line. This Experiment
cannot be practiſed in a Fiſſure of the lower Table, and no aſſurance
can be obtained in this matter till Symptoms appear.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms which diſcover the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> and Brain,
do ſuffer in Fractures of the Skull, are various, and ſhall be recited in
their proper places.</p>
               <p>If any Splinters of the Bone be broken off, they preſs on or
lacerate the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and ſometimes wound the Brain it ſelf,
and cauſe an extravaſation of Blood in it. When this happens, and Symptoms
diſcover the Brain is affected, and the Surgeon cannot evacuate the Matter
lodg'd on the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> he muſt proceed to Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But if the
Bone alone be concerned, though there be a Comminution or part of it cut off,
yet if no Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms appear, it is ſufficient to Dreſs the Wound after the
u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual manner.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> be inflamed, from whatever cauſe
this proceeds, there is a pain and oppreſſion of the Part, the Eyes are
bloated and inflamed, the Face is Red and Swoln, the Patient is
<hi>Comatoſe,</hi> there is a Fever kindled, attended with a hard Pulſe and
<hi>Rigors,</hi> the Patient voids Blood out of his Noſe, Ears or Mouth,
which laſt happens in great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the Brain.</p>
               <p>If there be any pointed Splinters, there is ground to fear they
may pierce through the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and Wound it. If there be a
depreſſion of the Skull; and ſome fragments be broke off, there is
reaſon to apprehend an extravaſation of Blood, and a Compreſſion of
that Membrane. If the <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42110:88"/>Fracture be large, and made with a
ſharp Inſtrument, it is moſt undoubtedly cut.</p>
               <p>If there be a Fiſſure of the Bone, the Patient be
<hi>Comatoſe,</hi> and Blood voided by the Mouth, Ears or Noſe with a
ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Fever, as was noted above, there is Matter lodg'd on the <hi>Dura
Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Weight or Oppreſſion proceeds from a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of
Matter which preſſes on the Brain, and its Arteries which convey Blood
into, and dilate it:</p>
               <p>The Swelling and Inflammation of the Eyes, proceed from the
Inflammation of the <hi>Sinus</hi> in the bottom of the Brain, which are
productions of the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> For theſe <hi>Sinus</hi> receiving
all the Refluent Blood from the Veins of the Eye, when their Mouths are
inflamed, muſt of neceſſity not receive it ſo faſt as it is conveyed
in by the Arteries, wherefore the Globe of the Eye receiving a conſtant
ſupply of Arterial Blood, while the Venal do's not paſs off, muſt needs
be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended and inflamed.</p>
               <p>The Inflammation of the Eye-lids, ariſes from the
Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> their internal Membrane being a
Continuation of that, and the Inflammation of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium</hi> it
ſelf, proceeds from the Pain caus'd by the Blows and Bruiſes it
receives.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that the Inflammation of the Eyes do's not
follow immediately upon the Hurt received; but at ſome diſtance of time
after, ſometimes upon the third, fourth or fifth Day. For the Inflammation
do's not ſpread it ſelf to its full extent of a ſudden, but gradually;
and there is a great Tract intervening for it to paſs thro', before it arrive
at the Eyes.</p>
               <p>The Bloated Swoln Face, proceeds from the Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the
<hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which ſtraitning the Mouths of the Internal Carotid
Arteries, forces part of the Blood (which would be conveyed to the Brain by
thoſe Channels) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitate and paſs off by the external Branches of
the ſame Arteries, to the ſeveral Parts of the Face.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Coma</hi> or Doſineſs, proceeds from an interruption
in the Circulation of the Blood, which Stagnates in the Veſſels of the
<hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and compreſſes the Brain, and by this means cloſing
the <hi>Meatus,</hi> intercepts the paſſage of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Now if waking
ariſes from an open free Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when this ceaſes by any
occaſional cauſe, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Brain, and cloſes the Pores,
its contrary Sleep or Doſineſs muſt unavoidably enſue.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:42110:89"/>
               <p>The Fever proceeds from the extravaſated Matter, firſt
corrupting, and then being abſorbed into the Blood. One drop of <hi>Pus</hi>
mixed with the Maſs, is ſufficient to produce this effect, and experience
ſhews us, that in Abſceſſes of the Lungs, nay of the external Parts
too, the Patient is never without a Fever.</p>
               <p>The hard deep Pulſe proceeds from a defect in the free
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood through the Brain, the impediment it meets with here,
preventing its rapid deſcent to the Heart, and its plentiful diſcharge into
the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rigor's</hi> or Shivering Fits, proceed from the
Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the extravaſated Matter lodg'd on the Membranes. This Acrimony
is contracted by its long Stagnating and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefying there, and when it pricks
the Membranes of the Brain, cauſes Convulſive Motions, and puts the Animal
Spirits into a tumultuous and diſorderly State, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in a
confuſed manner through the Nerves into the Muſcles, cauſes Shiverings,
Twitchings, and other irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Accidents.</p>
               <p>The Falling proſtrate on the Ground after a Blow receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
proceeds from a Concuſſion of the whole Brain, which puts the Spirits into
great Confuſion and Diſorder. Now the Spirits flying to and fro without the
Direction of the Mind, leave thoſe Nerves which convey them into the
Muſcles, which ſerve to keep the Body erect. Nay if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that a
greater quantity of Spirits are tranſmitted, this diſproportion alone is
ſufficient to explain this effect, ſince there cannot be an equal
contraction of the Muſcles to balance the Body.</p>
               <p>The loſs of Senſe, and a due perception of Objects,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a defect in the Tranſmiſſion of the Spirits, which are not
at all conveyed by the Nerves to their proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, or at leaſt in a
confus'd diſorderly manner.</p>
               <p>The Giddineſs or <hi>Vertigo</hi> ariſes from a violent and
irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motion of the Spirits, which whirling about the Optick Nerve,
impreſs the ſame motion on the Rays of Light, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Object,
and depicting it on the <hi>Retina.</hi> This cauſes the Objects themſelves
to appear as whirling round, ſince the Mind cannot have any Image of a
viſible Object, except by the impreſſion which its Rays make on the
Animal Spirits, reſiding in the Optick Nerve.</p>
               <p>The involuntary coming away of the Urine and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
proceeds from a defect in the Spirits, ſent to the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the
Bladder and <hi>Anus,</hi> which are not potent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <pb n="149" facs="tcp:42110:89"/>to
conſtringe them for the exerciſe of their retentive Faculty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Deliquium</hi> or Swooning ariſes from a want of
Spirits, which are not ſent in quantity enough to the Heart, to make ſo
vigorous a contraction as is neceſſary to drive the Blood into the extreme
Parts.</p>
               <p>The Vomiting proceeds from the impetuous ruſhing of the
Spirits into the Stomach, whoſe influx being for a time ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and
they collected in the Brain, at length reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their ordinary Courſe,
force their way through all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and violently entring the Part,
excite this Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. If the Vomiting follow immediately on the Blow, it is a
ſign the Concuſſion was not very great; On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if the Vomiting
happen after ſome time, it is a ſign that the Concuſſion is violent,
becauſe the greater the Shock is, the greater by conſequence the
Inflammation and Obſtruction, which it produces muſt be. But when the Shock
is ſlight, and theſe are not very conſiderable, the Spirits do not
ſtand in need of ſo vehement an Effort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe Obſtacles,
which impede their return to the Brain. In all great Concuſſions of the
Brain, the Patient Vomits Bile; but in leſſer, the Stomach only throws off
the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in its Cavity; the Reaſon of the difference is, that in all
great injuries the Shock extends to the Gall-Bladder, which diſcharges that
Sharp Liquour into the Stomach, and irritates it to a Convulſive Motion,
whereas in the other, the diſorderly Motion of the Spirits terminates in the
Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>The Brain it ſelf ſuffers by extravaſated Matter, which
either proceeds from the Rupture of ſome Veſſel in great Concuſſions,
or ſome Cut or Blow which pierces thro' the Membranes; or laſtly, Matter
which inſinuates it ſelf thro' them, and tranſlates it ſelf into the
Brain. The Symptoms which demonſtrate extravaſated Matter in the Brain, are
a Fever with Paroxyſms, Shivering Fits, Vomitings, Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Delirium,</hi> Lethargy, Apoplexies. In this caſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Liver
or Lungs apoſtemate, which is perceived by a conſtant Pain on the Side or
Region of the Liver, and frequent <hi>Rigors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have above aſcribed the Fever to the admixtion of the
purulent Matter, with the Maſs of Blood and the Fus, to a greater quantity
than ordinary diſcharged into it. For the purulent Matter which contracts an
Acrimony by its deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Brain, becomes a ſort of Ferment, which
upon <pb n="150" facs="tcp:42110:90"/>its mixture with that Vital Liquor, augments, its
Heat and Motion, and as often as a new ſupply is poured in, muſt
conſequently cauſe a new Commotion. This acrimonious Matter mixt with the
Blood in its Tour through the various Parts of the Body, pricks the Nerves,
moleſts the Stomach and Membranes. Sometimes paſſes into one Muſcle,
then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another and, cauſes Shiverings, Vomitings, and various
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Convulſive Motion; and when theſe effects appear, they
demonſtrate the Blood and Spirits to be contaminated, and that a
<hi>Delirium</hi> and Lethargy may be ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Delirium</hi> proceeds from the Hurry, and Diſorderly
Motion of the Blood in the Paroxyſm of the Fever, and the corruption of the
Brain by extravaſated Matter, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates into its ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>The Lethargy is the effect of a great quantity of Matter
extravaſated, which being vehemently agitated and corrupted to the higheſt
degree, its more ſubtil and fine parrs are carryed off by the rapid Motion of
the Blood, and the more heavy and unactive part left behind, which falling on
the Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous part of the Brain, blocks up the Pores, ſtops the
<hi>Oſtiola</hi> of the Glands, and intercepts the paſſage of the
Spirits; and the Brain being thus oppreſt and obſtructed, a proſound
<hi>Sopor</hi> muſt neceſſarily enſue. On the contrary, when the
extravaſated Matter begins to Diſſipate, and the heavy load which
oppreſſes the Glands, is in part driven away by the impulſe of new Blood,
the Spirits throw themſelves with great impetuoſity and diſorder into the
Parts. And this is the reaſon why <hi>Deliriums</hi> and Lethargies ſucceed
each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Turns. In Lethargies of this kind, the Patients Eyes are
commonly open, and very much diſturbed.</p>
               <p>The Apoplexy proceeds from the impetuous Motion of the Blood to
the Brain, and the exceſſive quantity of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated Matter, which by
its weight oppreſſes the Brain, obſtructs the paſſage of the Spirits,
and forces the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> to regurgitate on
every ſide, and drive back the Blood flowing into them and the Veins, by the
Arterial Channels. This oppreſſion and diſtention of the Brain,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all the Animal Functions, and ſoon puts a Period to the Patients
Life.</p>
               <p>Abſceſſes of the Liver or Lungs enſuing after Wounds of
the Head, are the effects of a Tranſlation of the Matter, which is firſt
abſorbed by the Maſs of Blood, and after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in theſe
<hi>Viſcera.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42110:90"/>
               <p>Wounds of the Brain are ever moſt dangerous, by how much
nearer they approach the <hi>Medulla oblongata;</hi> ſince the Nervous
Filaments which enter the white ſubſtance of the Brain, are in danger of
being cut.</p>
               <p>A Fracture made with a ſharp Inſtrument is not ſo
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as if made with a blunt one, or ſome Fall; for all cutting
Inſtruments do not make any great concuſſion of the Brain, the injury is
confin'd to the Part which the edge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but Falls and Blows ſhake the
whole Brain, burſt a thouſand ſmall Nervous Filaments, and ſometimes
Wound the Teguments, break the Skull in divers places, and ſeparate the
<hi>Dura Mater</hi> from it by the rudeneſs of the Shock.</p>
               <p>If the Wound be made with Fire-Arms, and hurt the Brain or
<hi>Dura Mater,</hi> it is deſperate; for this rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens without taking
off part of the Subſtance of the Brain, and the greatneſs of the
Contuſion is always attended with a ſpeedy putrefaction. But oftentimes
when the <hi>Cranium</hi> only is hurt, the Wound is not Mortal.</p>
               <p>In Wounds of the Head, we may conclude there is a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of
the Skull, if the Symptoms appear, tho' no Wound be in the Teguments. For as I
remarked above, theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pliant and extenſible, may give way to the
Blow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being divided by it, but the Skull which is hard and brittle,
eſpecially in Adults, muſt neceſſarily crack upon a violent Blow. For
this reaſon Great Maſts of Ships are made of diverſe Pieces, that each
may be more free to yield to the force of the Wind; whereas if they were made
of one piece only, it muſt be very thick to make a ſufficient
reſiſtance, and would be eaſily broken. Thus Swords may be broken without
hurting the Scabbard which contains them.</p>
               <p>In all Prognoſticks concerning Wounds of the Head, great
regard is to be had to the Patients Habit of Body, and the Violence of the
Blow. If there be a Fiſſure only, it is not ſo dangerous as when ſome
Splinters are broke off, and preſs on, or prick the Subjacent Membrane,
eſpecially if they hang together, and lie one over another; for thus they
make a ſtronger Compreſſion on the Brain. Beſides when the Skull is
broke in this manner, there is ground to believe the Blow is very violent, and
there is a great Concuſſion of the Brain, which is never without danger. If
the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> be torn by any Splinters of the Bone, the
extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Blood and the Inflammation, render the Wound dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:42110:91"/>
               <p>Great Commotions of the Brain are very dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in
the Univerſal Shock there is a diſruption of ſeveral Veſſels in
diverſe parts, and it is impoſſible to diſcharge and purge it from that
extraneous Matter which lodges in it, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefies and corrupts its
ſubſtance, and in the end proves Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Patient.</p>
               <p>If Vomiting happen in the time of a <hi>Delirium</hi> and
Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, it plainly ſhews, that the Spirits which animate the Brain, have
quitted their Poſt, and abandoned that Part to throw themſelves into the
Stomach, and this is a mortal Symptom.</p>
               <p>Grinding of the Teeth demonſtrates, that the extravaſated
Blood putrefies and corrupts the white Subſtance of the Brain.</p>
               <p>Wounds in the Cortical part of the Brain are not Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
eſpecially if the Aperture of the Skull be large enough to admit of the
application of Medicines to the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But if the Wound penetrate
the White Subſtance, it is ever Mortal; for this is compoſed of an infinite
multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Nervous Filaments, which being once divided, Death muſt
inevitably follow. Beſides great Branches of Arteries lie concealed in the
anfractuoſities of the Brain, which muſt neceſſarily be cut before any
Medicaments can be applyed, upon whoſe Diviſion an irremediable Flux of
Blood will enſue.</p>
               <p>It is proper before we proceed farther, to enquire in this
place, if it be neceſſary to apply the Trepan in a ſimple Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of
the Skull. To which I anſwer, Fiſſures of the Skull ſeldom happen
without affecting the Subjacent parts, which pleads for the uſe of the Trepan
in a ſimple Cleft: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in this Caſe it is moſt adviſeable to wait
till Symptoms appear, ſince the upper Table may be cleft, and the lower
remain entire.</p>
               <p>In Fiſſures of the Skull, a Tenſion of the <hi>Dura
Mater</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often enſures, becauſe this adheres to the Skull by a
mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Veſſels, which ſupply the inner Table with Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
and an infinity of Filaments which paſs thro' the Sutures, eſpecially in
Young Bodies. The Tenſion of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is often followed by an
Inflammation, becauſe the Veſſels cannot remain long in this State
without being broke and diſcharging Blood, which by its Stagnation grows
Acrimonious, pricks and moleſts the Membrane, and creates an Inflammation,
which ſometimes ends in a Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42110:91"/>
               <p>If in Fractures, Splinters of the Bone offend the <hi>Dura
Mater,</hi> the Patient ought to be trepann'd without farther delay (to prevent
all Accidents which may ariſe from extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated Blood) and the fragments
of the Bone remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>If both Tables of the Skull be broke, the Operation muſt be
made to prevent Accidents, though none as yet do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, for it is
impoſſible both theſe ſhould be broke, without any extravaſation on
the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be made an enquiry in this Place, if (after a blow on the
Head) the Skull appear entire, and yet by the Symptoms it be evident there is
Matter extravaſated on the Brain, whether in this caſe it be adviſable to
apply the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. There are ſome Practitioners who are for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;
alledging, when the <hi>Cranium</hi> is whole the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms may ariſe from a
great Commotion of the Brain, and it is impoſſible to determine the Place
where the Matter is lodged. Others pronounce it neceſſary to Trepan if any
of the Symptoms appear, and the Patient feel a fixed Pain in his Head. For my
private Opinion, I muſt declare for the latter; for if this extravaſated
Matter remains undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, the Patient in all probability muſt be killed
by it. Again, if you do not find Matter preciſely at the place of the
Aperture, the Head may be placed now on one ſide, now on the other, and the
Patient obliged to hold his Breath, ſhut his Mouth and Noſe to compreſs
the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> that the Matter may be evacuated.</p>
               <p>Wounds of the Head are more or leſs Dangerous, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to
the places in which they are. Fractures of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipital Bone are very
dangerous, becauſe the <hi>Cerebellum, Medulla oblongata,</hi> and Lateral
<hi>Sinus,</hi> poſſeſs that part of the Head. Theſe parts muſt
inevitably ſuffer great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and be much ſhattered, becauſe the
Occipital Bone requires great Violence to break it. Fractures on the top of the
Head, and in the place of the Fontanel are very dangerous, becauſe the Bones
in thoſe parts are very thin, and the blow being for the moſt part
perpendicular, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmart. The Danger do's not in this caſe depend on
the Brain, which lies beneath the Bone, becauſe we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Inſtances of loſs of Subſtance in theſe parts, and the Patient
notwithſtanding has been ſucceſsfully cured. Fractures in the Sutures are
more dangerous than in the other parts, by reaſon of the numerous Filaments
and Veſſels which are apt to be broken and ſpill the Blood contained in
them on <pb n="154" facs="tcp:42110:92"/>the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> Fractures on the
<hi>Sinus</hi> over the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows are very inconvenient, and difficult to Cure,
becauſe theſe <hi>Sinus's</hi> being lined with an infinity of ſmall
Glands, furniſh matter perpetually for Suppuration.</p>
               <p>When after a due and exact conſideration of all Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, it
do's appear there is <hi>Pus</hi> extravaſated on the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi>
there is a neceſſity of proceeding to the Operation; but becauſe it may
be both difficult and hazardous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo nice a matter as this is,
without an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Structure of the Skull; I ſhall before I
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Method of performing it, premiſe a deſcription of its
Compoſition and Parts.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Structure of the <hi>Cranium.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The Cranium or <hi>Skull, is a Bone compos'd of diverſe
Pieces, joyned togethert in a moſt Artful manner, ſo as to form a Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to contain the Brain, and defend it from external inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nature has not made the Skull one entire Bone, but form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it
out of ſeveral Pieces, the better to enable it to reſiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Hurts,
to which it is expos'd, and to prevent any Fracture extending too far upon a
blow received. Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks ſeem to imitate this Artifice in works expoſed
to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent attacks; for inſtance, in Maſts of Ships which are ever made of
ſeveral pieces put together, that ſo being flexible they may be leſs apt
to break.</p>
                  <p>Each Bone of the Skull is compos'd of two Tables, the Inner
and the Outer. The Outer is a little harder than the Inner, and covered with
the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> The Inner has divers Inequalities or Furrows, which
the Veſſels of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> firſt excavated, and after
enlarged, while this Plate was very tender and ſoft, by their continual
beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>There is a Medullary Subſtance called by the <hi>Greeks
Diploe,</hi> and by the <hi>Latins Meditullium,</hi> which lies between the two
Tables, and interſperſed with Veins and Arteries, for its Nouriſhment
like the Marrow in the other Bones of Human Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The two Tables of the Skull are ſolid, and ſerve as a
Rampart to defend the Brain, to prevent this being too heavy, as it would be if
it were one entire ſolid Bone; there is placed by the Providence of Nature a
ſpungy light Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which by its unctuoſity humecting the Bone,
makes <pb n="155" facs="tcp:42110:92"/>it more tough and leſs brittle, and diſpoſes
it to yield a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to external Blows without cracking. Architects imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
this Structure, by laying Mortar between their Maſſy Stones, which by their
vaſt weight would break, if ſome ſoft ſubſtance did not intervene to
bear off the preſſure. The <hi>Cranium</hi> of an Elephant is of a vaſt
biggneſs, and ſeems to be ponderous, and yet is really very light, and ſo
the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of Oſtriches and other Animals; for theſe Maſſes
of Bones are compos'd of two thin plates, which contain a great many ſpungy
<hi>Lamellae</hi> within.</p>
                  <p>The Magnitude of the Head, is proportioned to the largeneſs
of the Brain. Its beſt and moſt Natural Figure is Oval, ſomething
riſing before and behind, and flat on the ſides. The eminence before and
behind contains the Brain and Cerebel, and the flatneſs of the ſides
conduces to the more advantageous placing the Organs of the two Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of
Sight and Hearing.</p>
                  <p>The Artiſt ought to be fully acquainted with the Figure,
Aſperities, Depreſſions and Sutures of the Skull, to prevent being
impoſed on; when he ſearches it to diſcover whether there be any
Depreſſion after a Blow received.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients pretend, that when any Eminence is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either before or behind the Head, there are but two Sutures in the
<hi>Cranium,</hi> which repreſent a T, that when the Head is entirely round,
there are two Sutures croſſing each other, and forming an X; and laſtly,
that when the Eminences before and behind jet very much out, there are three
Sutures which form and H. <hi>Volcherus Coiter</hi> relates, that he had ſeen
at the Houſe of that Learned Anatomiſt <hi>Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> one which wanted
the anteriour Riſing, and both the Temporal and Coronal Sutures.</p>
                  <p>All the Bones of the Skull are united by Indentures, which are
termed Sutures. Theſe Sutures are True, Falſe or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; True Sutures are
thoſe which joyn the principal Bones of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and reſemble
Stitches. Of this kind there are three, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Coronal</hi>
which joyns the <hi>Coronal</hi> Bone, or Bones of the Forehead to the
<hi>Parietal.</hi> The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittal</hi> which proceeds along the top of the
Head, from the fore to the hinder part, and joyns the <hi>Parietal</hi> Bones;
and the <hi>Lambdoidal</hi> which joyns the <hi>Occipital</hi> to the
<hi>Parietal</hi> Bones.</p>
                  <p>There are three Common Sutures which ſeparate the Bones of
the upper Jaw, from the <hi>Cranium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:42110:93"/>
                  <p>The Sutures which joyn the Bones of the Temples to the
Parietal Bones, are called Squammoſe or Scaly, upon a ſuppoſition, they
barely lie over the Parietal Bone, as the Scales of Fiſhes do one over
another. But this is a miſtake, proceeding from a tranſient view; for upon
a more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate inſpection it appears, that all the Bones of the Skull are
indented with each other, and the Temporal Bone as well as the reſt, is full
of ſeveral little Angles, where it joyns to the Parietal. It may be remarked
here, that the extreme edge of the Bone of the Temples, and that of the
Parietal ſlope very much.</p>
                  <p>We have noted above, that there are three true Sutures,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Coronal, Sagittal and Lambdoidal. The firſt receives its
name from its reſembling a Circular Coronet, or the <hi>Greek</hi> Womens
wearing a Coronet or Garland of Flowers on it. The Sagittal is ſo called from
the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Sagitta,</hi> or an Arrow, becauſe it ſhoots in
a ſtreight Line, from the hinder to the fore part of the Head. The third is
denominated from its Figure, which is not unlike the <hi>Lambda</hi> or Λ
of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Antient Phyſicians made Fontanels on the
concourſe of the Sagittal and Coronal, and the Sagittal and Lambdoical Suture
to cure Defluxions on the Eyes.</p>
                  <p>The common Sutures may be reduced to two, That which joyns the
<hi>Os Ethmoides;</hi> and the other which joyn the <hi>Os Sphaenoides;</hi>
for the Tranſverſal is no more than a Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Coronal.</p>
                  <p>The Principal uſe of the Sutures, is to hinder the Fracture
of one Bone from extending to another, to ſuſpend the <hi>Dura Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
by giving paſſage to ſeveral Veſſels and Nervous Filaments proceeding
from the <hi>Pericranium;</hi> and laſtly, to give way for inſenſible
Tranſpiration. The laſt uſe aſſign'd to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is evinced by
the violent Head-achs, ordinary in ſuch Perſons where Tranſpirations is
obſtructed by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cloſeneſs of the Sutures. In ſome
Perſons ſubject to perpetual pains in the Head, the Sutures have been found
ſeparated.</p>

                  <p>The Bones which compoſe the <hi>Cranium,</hi> are the
<hi>Coronal</hi> which poſſeſſes the whole Fore-part, the
<hi>Occipital</hi> which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the whole hinder part, and the
<hi>Parietal</hi> Bones which form the ſides. The <hi>Os Sphaenoides</hi> or
Wedgelike Bone, and <pb n="175" facs="tcp:42110:93"/>the <hi>Os Ethmoides</hi> are common
to the Skull and the Face. The minute Bones of the Ear, the <hi>Malleus,
Incus</hi> and <hi>Stapes,</hi> are contained in the Cavity of the <hi>Os
Petroſum,</hi> or craggy Bone of the Temples.</p>
                  <p>The Coronal Bone poſſeſſes all the forepart of the
Head, and receives its Name from the Crown of Laurel, placed on the Victors
Brows. It is called the <hi>Os Frontis,</hi> becauſe theſe Bones together
form the Forehead, and is of a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular Figure, ſmooth and polite
without, and very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual within, by the Impreſſion made by the
Veſſels of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> whilſt the Bone is yet ſoft and
tender. In ſome Skulls the Sagittal Suture is continued down to the Root of
the Noſe, and the Frontal Bone divided into two, which diviſion ſome
Authors pretend happens more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Women than Men.</p>
                  <p>The Coronal Bone is a little thicker before than the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietal, and by conſequence the Surgeon may turn his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with
leſs fear in this, than the other which are thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This Bone is joyned to
the Parietal Bones by the Coronal Suture, and to the <hi>Ethmoides,
Sphaenoides,</hi> and the Bones of the lower Jaw by the common Suture. In the
forepart, it compoſes a great part of the Orbit of the Eyes. The Plates of
this Bone are ſeparated above the <hi>Supercilia</hi> or Eye-brows, and form
two Cavities which extend to the middle of the Forehead, and ſometimes are
very large, and at others very ſmall. There is great caution to be uſed in
Trepanning in this place; for when the Brows are large and prominent, the
Sinuoſities likewiſe are large, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend far. Theſe Cavities open by a
common <hi>Foramen</hi> into the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>Anatomiſts have entertain'd various conjectures of the uſe
of theſe Cavities, ſome are of Opinion they ſerve to reflect the Voice,
and form an Echo; alledging, that if theſe be deficient, the Voice is flat.
Others believe they are a Magazin of Air which ſerves for the production of
the Animal Spirits, and imagine this Air do's paſs thro' the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Angle
of the Eye to cool it, and that it do's likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much aſſiſt the
Senſe of Smelling. But ſince theſe Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are lined with a Glandulous
Membrane, interwoven with abundance of Blood-Veſſels, it is but
reaſonable to think, theſe Glands diſcharge a great part of their
Seroſities and <hi>Mucus</hi> inſenſibly into the Noſe. For we ever
find the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> to be furniſhed by the Aperture of ſeveral
<hi>Sinus;</hi> as for inſtance, the Bones of the upper Jaw and <hi>Os
Sphaenoides,</hi>

Membrane: The perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lachrymal Bone, drain a great quantity of
Moiſture through the Noſe, by the Tears evacuated that way.</p>
                  <p>The Coronal Bone has ſeveral Holes; for inſtance, two
external above the Brows which pierce the Orbit, and thro' theſe paſſes a
Branch of the Nerves of the Third Pair, which is diſpenſed to the Skin,
Muſcles of the Forehead and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids. Beſides the external, there is one
within above the <hi>Apophyſis,</hi> commonly called <hi>Criſta Galli,</hi>
to which the Root of the right <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi>

                  <p>It is diverting to conſider the Oſſification of this
Bone, which begins at the Circumference, and ſo proceeds to the Center,
contrary to all others, which proceed from the Center to the Circumference. In
a <hi>Foetus</hi> of two Months old, the Coronal Bone is a Membrane, which by
degrees becomes Cartilaginous. In the third Month ſeveral Points appear,
which like ſo many Centers, begin the Oſſification and above the Orbits,
on each ſide a bony Creſcent appears. In the fourth Month the bone is
Oſſified, except its middle, which ſtill remains Membranous. The Orbits
and the Hole thro' which the Motory Nerves of the Eye do paſs, begin then to
be formed. The Coronal is divided into two bones by a Suture, which paſſes
through its midſt, which is very cloſe at the end next the Noſe, and very
large at the other near the Fontanel: the bony points of the Orbits which
appear as through a Cloud, are very diſcernable. In the fifth and ſixth
Month the Oſſification advances, the Fontanel is leſſen'd, and the
middle of the Coronal is bony; and in the ſeventh Month the Oſſification
is perfected. The longitudinal <hi>Sinus</hi> is ſeen through the Fontanel,
in the eighth Mouth. <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kringius</hi> in his Hiſtory of the

place where the Sagittal meets the Coronal Suture. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls

Temporal and Sphaenoidal Bone; for the Oſſification of the Parietal Bones
begins at the Center, and terminates at the Circumference, contrary to the
proceſs of Nature, in the Coronal Bone. In the fifth and ſixth Month
theſe bones grow conſiderably, and approach very near each other, ſo that

ſelf into the hard and the ſoft Branch. Of the External, the firſt is the
<hi>Meatus Auditorius,</hi> or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory paſſage. The ſecond is oblique,
and tranſmits a Vein to the Jugulars. The third lies between the
<hi>Maſtoides</hi> and <hi>Styloides</hi> Proceſſes, and the fourth
penetrates the Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſage, and is called the Communicant Duct,

                  <p>In the ſecond Month the bones of the Temples are
Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous. In the third Month the <hi>Zygomatick</hi> Proceſs, and the
Circle to which the Membrane of the <hi>Tympanum</hi> or Drum is fixed, are
bony. But during the whole ſtay of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, the
Auditory Channel is Cartilaginous, and Nature to preſerve the Drum, has drawn
a thick Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane over it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Styloidal</hi> Proceſſes are of a bright red
Colour like a Ruby, and lie cloſe to the bony Circle, from whence they derive
their Origin, not extending themſelves, and ſtanding out as they afterwards
do. Theſe Proceſſes do not Oſſifie, till a long time after the Birth,
extending themſelves gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſtanding more and more out and
encreaſing. In the fourth Month, the Scaly part of the <hi>Os Petroſum</hi>
becomes bony. The Cavities which compoſe the Organ of Hearing, are included
in the craggy Proceſs, and are formed of a bright red Cartilage. The craggy
Proceſs is as yet wholly Cartilaginous, and there is nothing bony in it,
beſides a little rough unequal Line, which extends the whole length of the
bony Circle, and ſo paſſes beyond it. At this time the Temporal bone is
compos'd of three ſmall bones, the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or Scaly bone, the Ring or bony
Circle, and the ſtraight Line of the craggy Proceſs. In the fifth Month,
the Scaly part of the Temporal bone is joyned to the <hi>Sphaenoides,</hi> and
Parietal bone. The Mammillary Proceſs is formed of three ſmall bones, the
firſt is called <hi>Pyriformis,</hi> from its reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a Pear, which is
joyned by its ſlender end, to the Squammous bone. The ſecond is called
<hi>Scutiformis,</hi> from its reſembling a Buckler, and is near as thick as
the other. The third bone is about the thickneſs of a pin Head, and divided
from the other by the ſame Cartilage.</p>
                  <p>Near the hole through which the Auditory Nerve paſſes,
there is another hole, which in Adults is of a long ſtrait 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42110:96"/>Figure like a ſmall Cleft. The Temporal bone is of a
more irregular Figure in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> than in Adults.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>Foetus</hi> of ſix Months old, the Maſſy part
of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is bony. The longeſt branch of the Hammer is entirely
Cartilaginous, and adheres to the Membrane of the Drum. The <hi>Incus</hi> or
Anvil has nothing Cartilaginous, except the top of its <hi>Apophyſis.</hi>
The <hi>Baſis,</hi> and the two Branches of the Stirrup are bony, the Stirrup
it ſelf appears Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular above. The fourth or Orbicular bone is
deficient in the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fifth Month, the Temporal bone is compos'd of ſix
ſmall bones, diſtinct from each other, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſcaly part of
the bony Circle, (which has a Channel or Rift, in which the Membrane of the
<hi>Tympanum</hi> is enclos'd) the craggy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which contains the Organs

                  <p>In the ſixth Month, the <hi>Scutiformis</hi> and
<hi>Pyriformis</hi> unite into one. The third bone is a little thicker, the
Stirrup is not formed; the Hammer and Anvil are a little thicker, but their
hardneſs continues the ſame. In the ſeventh Month, the ſmalleſt bone
of the Mammillary Proceſs joyns to the <hi>Scutiformis</hi> and
<hi>Pyriformis.</hi> The ſmall bones of the Ear do not differ from thoſe in
Adults, except that the longer Branch of the Hammer at firſt is only

Stirrup, Anvil and Hammer.</p>
                  <p>The Stirrup is a ſmall bone, which derives its Name from its
Figure. It is compos'd of two Branches, fixed on a flat Oval Baſis. In the

formed, in which the fourth bone is lodged.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond bone takes its Name from a Smiths Anvil, which it
is not very much unlike. It conſiſts of three parts; the firſt is the
thickeſt of all, and forms the Body of the bone, the two other are ſmall
Branches, and are only <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſes</hi> of the former. The more bulky part
has two Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and one Protuberance to articulate with the Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Cavity of the Head of the Hammer. This Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation reſembles a
Hinge.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42110:96"/>
                  <p>The Hammer is a little bone, which is ſomething like a
Workmans Hammer, the greater and thicker extremity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Head,
and the thinner and ſlenderer the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. The hinder part of the Head of the
Hammer has two Protuberances, and one Cavity adapted to receive the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. The
Handle is long and ſlender, and is made thicker by two
<hi>Apophyſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Bone has ſcarce any diſcernible thickneſs,
and is not very much unlike the Scales of ſome Fiſhes. It is convex on the
ſide where it joyns the Head of the Stirrup, and a little hollow where it is
Articulated with the tip of the Anvil. None of theſe bones are covered with
the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſteum,</hi> and all are kept together in the place of their
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation with Ligaments. They all have little Holes for the Reception of
thoſe Veſſels which import Nouriſhment to them. The Hammer and Anvil
are more ſolid, than the Stirrup, which is an exceeding thin and porous

                  <p>There is no bone of the Head requires more Care and Caution in
trying it with the Probe to diſcover its Fractures, than this, which
Difficulty proceeds from its irregular and and capricious Figure. The Occipital
Bone compoſes all the lower and hinder part of the Skull. Its Figure is
ſomething Lozenge, and it is near an inch in Thickneſs. Its exteriour part
is unequal. This Bone has two <hi>Condyli</hi> or flattiſh round knobs, which
are received in the two <hi>Sinus</hi> of the firſt <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra</hi> of the
Neck, by means of which Articulation, the Flexion and Extenſion of the Neck
is performed. There are in its inner ſide two great Cavities, which receive
the Cerebel; Beſides theſe there are two leſſer lateral ones with two
remarkable Furrows winding obliquely above the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cavities. Through
theſe Furrows the two lateral <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi>
paſs, which diſcharge their Blood into the Jugulars; in the laſt place
there is a Protuberance, to which the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> adheres.</p>
                  <p>The Occipital is joyned to the Parietal, Temporal, and
Sphaenoidal bones. This bone has ſive Holes, <hi>viz.</hi> The Great one,
through which the Spinal Marrow paſſes; two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ones, and two more
between its <hi>Condyli</hi> and <hi>Proceſſus Styloides.</hi> The lower
part of this bone has ſeveral Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, to which Muſcles are
inſerted. There is ſometimes a Triangular bone enchaſed into the
Occipital, by three <pb n="164" facs="tcp:42110:97"/>Sutures. Sometimes this Triangular
bone is cleft through the midſt, and each moiety joyn'd by a Suture.</p>
                  <p>The Lambdoidal Suture is frequently interrupted by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

well the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces of which it conſiſts, the ſmall Sutures, and
the Triangular bone juſt now mentioned; for without this neceſſary
caution, he will be apt to be impos'd on by its great inequality, and may be
induced to believe it broke when it is entire.</p>

                  <p>In the third Month after Conception, the Occipital bone
conſiſts of four Triangular ones, <hi>viz.</hi> one great, and three
ſmall ones. The great Triangular bone is ſometimes all of one piece, and at
other times it is made up of two, three or four bones joyned together. After
the leſſer bones which compoſe the great Triangular one, are united into
one large bone, there is uſually formed another leſs one of a Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
figure likewiſe, one of whoſe Angles touches the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Triangular, and
the two other extend to the Condyloidal Proceſſes.</p>
                  <p>In the ninth Month, this bone is united to the Condyloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
Proceſſes, and the great Triangular bone. The ſmall bone beneath theſe
Condyloidal Proceſſes is triangular like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and continues diſtinct;
but ſometimes after the Birth it is united to the great Triangular, and the
two Condyloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal proceſſes of the Occipital bone. In a <hi>Foetus</hi> of
nine Months old, the great Triangular is ſometimes divided into four unequal
Portions. From the above recited particulars it is evident, there is no bone in

contiguous to almoſt all the bones of the Head, being crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like a Wedge

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42110:97"/>difficult to give a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of it by a Verbal
Deſcription, and may be better learnt by once ſeeing it, than by all the
words in the World. On its upper ſide it is joyn'd to the Temporal Coronal
and Cheek bone, and on its lower to the two greateſt bones of the upper Jaw,
the Occipital and the <hi>Vomer.</hi> It has five Proceſſes on its external
Part, two of which reſemble the Wings of a Bat, and by the <hi>Greeks</hi>
are called the <hi>Pterygoidal</hi> or Wing-like Proceſſes, in which are
two <hi>Sinus</hi> termed <hi>Foſſae.</hi> Beſides theſe, there are two
more which are flat and ſmooth, which form a Part of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and the

<hi>Foſſae,</hi> and a ſmall Proceſs which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed in a Channel

Proceſſes, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> term <hi>Clinoidal,</hi> becauſe
they bear ſome reſemblance to the Poſts of a Bed. Between theſe
Proceſſes, there is a Cavity which contains the Pituitary Gland, and this
is called the <hi>Sella,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not unlike a Saddle. Between the
Tables of the <hi>Os Sphaenoides,</hi> there is a double Cavity ſeparated by

theſe <hi>Sinus,</hi> and by this way is conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mouth. But there
is little probability of the truth of this conjecture, becauſe there are no

                  <p>There are nine pair of Nerves which ſpring from the Spinal
Marrow, and paſs out of the Skull through as many ſeveral Holes. The
firſt pair ſerves the ſenſe of Smelling, and is divided below the
<hi>Os Cribroſion</hi> into ſeveral Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which paſſing through
ſeveral Holes, are diſpenſed to the internal Tunick of the Noſe. The
ſecond pair are the Optick or Viſive Nerves, which paſs into the Orbit
through ſeveral Holes, excavated in the Sphaenoidal bone, immediately above
the Anteriour Clinoidal Proceſſes. In that Portion of the Sphaenoidal bone
which forms the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Orbit, there is a Fiſſure about half an inch
in length, which in the lower part beneath the Hole through which the Optick
Nerve paſſes, is almoſt round, and larger above where it terminates in a
very long acute Angle. There are ſeveral Nerves which enter the Orbit through
this Cleft; as 1. The third pair called the Motory Nerves of the Eye. 2. The
fourth pair called by <hi>Willis</hi> the Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. 3. The ſixth pair.
Beſides theſe three pair which paſs intirely through this Cleft, there
paſſes likewiſe the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Branch of the anteriour Trunk of the fifth
pair, which Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> calls the Ophthalmick Branch. Beyond the
infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of this cleft, towards the hinder part of the Head, there
appears on each ſide in the Sphaenoidal bone, a Hole which do's not pierce
the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Skull, but makes a ſort of a Channel about an
inch long. This Channel opens behind the Orbit at the top of the ſpace
between the Pteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goidal Proceſs, and the third bone of the upper Jaw. The
inferiour Branch of the Fore-Trunk of the fifth pair, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through this
Channel. About the ſixth part of an inch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Channels, there are two
more Holes in the Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noidal bone of ſomething an Oval Figure. Theſe lie
on the back ſide of the <hi>Sella,</hi> through which the poſteriour Trunk
of the fifth pair paſſes. The Hole through which the Auditory Nerve or
ſeventh pair paſſes, is in the midſt of the poſteriour part of the
<hi>Os Petroſum,</hi> which looks towards the Cerebel. This Hole which is
very large is the Mouth of a Duct or Channel, which running through the <hi>Os
Petroſum,</hi> and ſinking obliquely downwards to the depth of a ſixth 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42110:99"/>part of an Inch, forms the bottom of a Sack, terminating
partly in the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the <hi>Cochlea,</hi> and partly in the Mouth
or Entry of the <hi>Veſtibulum.</hi> At the bottom of this Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel are
ſeveral Holes; The moſt conſiderable of theſe is, that in the upper
part through which a portion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory Nerve paſſes, and this is the
entry of another Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel made in the <hi>Os Petroſum,</hi> which opens
between the <hi>Maſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idal</hi> and <hi>Styloidal</hi> Proceſſes. The
other Holes tranſmit the branches of the ſoft pair of the Auditory Nerves.
Below this Channel, there is a conſiderable Hole formed by the meeting of two
unequal Ridges, the largeſt of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Occipital bone, and
the other from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of the craggy Proceſs. From the middle of
the Superiour part of this Hole, there is a ſmall bony point jetts out, to
which an Appendix of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is affixed, which divides the Hole
into two parts. Through the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of theſe, the Nerves of the eighth
pair and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nerve paſſes out; as for the poſteriour Hole, its
uſe ſhall hereafter be aſſigned. Near the great Hole of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipital
bone through which the Spinal Marrow paſſes, there is an Oval Hole through
which a Nerve of the ninth pair paſſes. This Hole is entirely made in the
Occipital bone, and proceeding a little forward, paſſes obliquely from
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind forwards. In the forepart of the Skull that Hole is ſometimes double,
but its two Mouths reunite on the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of the Skull, and the two
Branches which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Origin of that Nerve paſſing through them
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, unite before they leave the bone. Thus I have enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated all the
paſſages of the nine pair of Nerves, which proceed from the <hi>Medulla
Oblongata;</hi> there remains only the Intercoſtal Nerve, and the tenth pair:
The firſt of which paſſes out of the Skull by the ſame Hole, through

is another little roundiſh Hole, which tranſmits a Branch of the external

and ſends out divers Ramifications, which ſupply with blood all that

of the Orbit, above the acute Angle of the cleft of the Sphaenoidal bone, there
is a Hole through which a ſmall Artery paſſes, which ſprings from that
Branch of the internal Carotid, which imports Blood to the Eye. This Artery is
diſpenſed to all that part of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which covers the
Anteriour part of the Brain. The Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bral Artery after it enters the Skull,
diſpenſes a conſiderable Branch on each ſide, which is diſpenſed to
all the Portion of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> which covers the Cerebel. As for the
Veins which accompany theſe Arteries, they paſs almoſt all out of the
Skull by the ſame Holes, through which the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries enter in. There are four
great Arteries which ſupply the Brain with Blood and Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi>
the two internal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotids; and the two Vertebrals. The Internal Carotids
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Skull by a particular Channel in the Temporal Bone. The Mouth
of this Channel is of an Oval Figure, and is ſeated on the external part of
the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the <hi>Crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> before the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the
Internal Jugular. This Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel proceeds obliquely from behind forwards, and
after run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about a quarter of an inch in length, ends near the poſteriour
part of the <hi>Sella</hi> in the Sphaenoidal Bone. The Artery makes a
<hi>Flexus</hi> here, which forms a Roman S. In the place where the Carotid
Arteries ſtrike through the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> they ſend out a great
Branch which paſſes into the Orbit, by the Inferiour part of that Hole
which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Optick Nerve. The Vertebral Arteries iſſuing out of
the Holes of the Tranſverſe Proceſſes of the firſt <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi>
of the Neck, in their Progreſs are reflected under the Superiour Oblique
Proceſſes of 7 other <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> after this they ſtrike through
the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and running along on the Spinal Marrow, enter the
Skull through the great Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Hole, and then inclining to each other,
unite and form but one Trunk. The Veins which export the Refluent Blood from
the ſubſtance of the Brain, empty their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents into the <hi>Sinus</hi>
of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> all which diſcharge themſelves into the Lateral
ones, which iſſue out of the Skull immediately below the Nerves of the
eighth pair, by the hinder part of the Hole formed by the juncture of the
Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipital bone, and craggy Proceſs. The Lateral <hi>Sinus</hi> open into the
internal Jugulars, whoſe Mouths are contained in a conſiderable
<hi>Sinus,</hi> wrought on each ſide of the external part of the
<hi>Baſis</hi> of the Skull, and commonly known by the <pb n="170" facs="tcp:42110:100"/>Name of the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the internal Jugular Veins. In the
upper and poſteriour part of the Hole through which the Lateral
<hi>Sinus</hi> go out, there is an Aperture which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of a
Channel. This Channel has its Mouth or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try behind thoſe Condyls, which
ſtand on each ſide the great Occipital Hole, and after a Courſe of about
a ſixth part of an inch through the Subſtance of the Bone, opens
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into the Vertebral <hi>Sinus,</hi> from whence indeed it ſeems
to take its Origin. From hence it is evident, that the blood contained in the
Lateral <hi>Sinus</hi> is diſcharged two ſeveral ways, <hi>viz.</hi> The
greateſt Portion into the Jugulars, and the other into the Vertebral
<hi>Sinus,</hi> which ſometimes appear only on one ſide, at other times are
intercepted on both ſides, and then all the Blood contained in the Lateral
<hi>Sinus,</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged into the internal Jugulars. Behind the
Maſtoidal Proceſs, there is on each ſide a conſiderable Hole, through
which paſſes a large Vein, which conveys back a great part of the Refluent
blood from the Teguments and Muſcles, on the hinder ſide of the Head. This
Vein opens into the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral <hi>Sinus,</hi> in the place where there
Flexuoſity begins. In ſome Subjects, this Hole is only on one ſide, and
ſometimes there is none at all to be found; when this happens, the Blood
contained in theſe Veſſels, is emptied into the External Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, with
which the Branches of this Veſſel communicate in three places on each
Parietal bone, on the ſide of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittal Suture, and at a little
diſtance from the Lambdoidals. There is a Hole through which paſſes a
Vein which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys back the Refluent Blood from the Tegument of the Head, and
this empties it ſelf into the upper Longitudinal <hi>Sinus.</hi> Theſe
Paſſages are ſometimes ſtopt upon one ſide, and ſometimes on both,
in which caſe the Blood contained in the Branches of this Vein, is
diſcharged into the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jugular. In the midſt of the <hi>Sella,</hi>
there are two or three ſmall Holes, through which ſome Modern Authours have
imagined the <hi>Lympha</hi> contained in the Pituitary Gland is diſcharged
into the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Sella;</hi> but theſe Holes are filled
with Veſſels which carry the Refluent Blood from the Adjacent Bones and
Membranes; nay, theſe Holes themſelves are ſeldom to be found in Adult
Perſons. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ridge of the Coronal Bone, and that of the
<hi>Chriſta Galli,</hi> there is a Hole which is the Mouth or Entry of a
Channel, which takes its courſe downwards for the ſpace of about the
ſixth part of an inch, through the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the inner Table of the
Coronal Bone: The Root <pb n="171" facs="tcp:42110:100"/>of the upper Longitudinal
<hi>Sinus</hi> is inſerted here, and it likewiſe tranſmits ſeveral
Blood-Veſſels which ſerve for the Nouriſhment of the inner Table.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral other Holes in other parts of the
<hi>Baſis</hi> of the Skull, the Principal of which are on the craggy
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Theſe tranſmit diverſe Veſſels for the Nouriſhment of
the Temporal bone, which contains the bones of the <hi>Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panum.</hi> The
other Holes tranſmit Veſſels which ſupply with blood, the various parts
of the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Skull.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>In applying the Trepan, the Artiſt muſt ever obſerve not
to fix his Inſtrument on the Sutures, eſpecially the Fontanel; becauſe
there are, as I before noted, an infinity of ſmall Veſſels which paſs
through them, and connect the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> to the Skull in thoſe
places. If the Operation were made there, there would be great Danger of
tearing thoſe Fibres and Veſſels with its Teeth, or perhaps opening the
Longitudinal <hi>Sinus</hi> in Trepanning on the Sagittal Suture. If the Blow
happen to be on the Sutures, and you judge there is Blood extravaſated on
each ſide of the Head, the ſureſt way is to apply the Inſtrument on
both ſides, becauſe the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> adheres to the Sutures ſo
ſtrictly, that there can be no Communication from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Trepan muſt never be placed directly in the middle of
the Coronal, nor the Occipital bone, eſpecially towards their lower parts;
becauſe the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> adheres very firmly to the productions in
theſe places, and there is great danger of tearing it in turning round of the
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>You muſt never Trepan on the Eye-brows, becauſe of the
great Cavities beneath, which are lined with a very thick Membrene, and the
bone being double in this place, inſtead of coming to the Brain after the
Perforation is made, you only diſcover a Cavity, and there remains ſtill
another bone to go through, which makes the Operation difficult and
troubleſome. Beſides as we obſerved before, the Wound would be a long
time in Healing, becauſe the Glandulous Membrane which lines the Cavity,
ſupplies matter for a plentiful Suppuration.</p>
                  <p>You muſt never Trepan on the Temporal bone, unleſs in
caſe of great neceſſity, eſpecially in that part where it is 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42110:101"/>contiguous to the Parietal, becauſe here its thinneſt
part joyns to the lower part of the Parietal, and one part of the Temporal bone
muſt neceſſarily eſcape, ſince it only lies on the Parietal, and this
creates great difficulty in the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>You muſt never Trepan on the Lateral <hi>Sinus,</hi> which
lie on the ſide of the Occipital, for fear of opening thoſe <hi>Sinus</hi>
with the Teeth of the Inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>When any Fragment of a bone is depreſt, or there is a
Comminution; you muſt not fix the Trepan over them, but on one ſide. For if
you ſhould place it over, you would run a risk of thruſting thoſe
Fragments into the Brain, and Mortally wounding the Patient; and for this
Reaſon, the Inſtrument is better applyed laterally, than on the
Depreſſion it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Trepan may be applyed on any other part of the Skull,
except thoſe mentioned; but if the Bone be much ſhattered, and the
Fragments or Splinters be ſo large, that upon the taking them out there is
ſufficient room for the Application of Medicines; you may ſuperſede the
uſe of this Inſtrument, there being no occaſion for any farther
Perforation.</p>
                  <p>The Inciſion of the Teguments muſt be made after ſome of
the following ways, <hi>viz.</hi> On the Temporal Muſcle it muſt have the
Figure of the number 7, or Letter V, or which is better be made lengthways,
following the courſe of the Fibres, and be large enough to place the
Inſtrument. In all other places of the Head, the Inciſion is ordinarily
made in form of a Croſs; <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> but I think the long T is better, provided
there be room enough to apply the Inſtrument. In Wounds of the Forehead the
Inciſion is beſt made tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, following the courſe of the
Wrinkles, for then the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> will create leſs Deformity.</p>
                  <p>After a blow on the Head it is neceſſary to ſearch,
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Skull is bare; and if the Orifice be not large enough,
it muſt be Dilated, and the Bone laid bare, in order to diſcover the Nature
of the Fracture. When the Inciſion is made, the Wound muſt be filled with
dry Lint to abſorb the Blood, which otherwiſe would hinder a due
inſpection of it. If Blood iſſue from any Artery, the Artiſt muſt
make a Ligature on it, and leave the Wound in this condition till the next
day.</p>
                  <p>If the Bone be very much ſhattered, and ſome Fragments of
it depreſſed, it muſt be raiſed, and you muſt leave the 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42110:101"/>Dreſſing till the Haemorrhage be ſtopt, that ſo
you may conſider of the beſt place to apply the Trepan.</p>
                  <p>After the Inciſion is made (whether it be of the form of a
Croſs, <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, V or T) the Teguments removed, and the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi>
ſcraped off (by a <hi>Spatula,</hi> or with the Nails) the Flux of Blood
ſtopt, and four and twenty Hours are lapſed, ſince all theſe
Preparatives are made (which laſt Circumſtance is not always neceſſary,
eſpecially when ſome preſſing Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms require greater Haſt) you may
proceed to the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>Place the Patients Head in a convenient Poſture; this is
ordinarily done by laying it on a Pillow, and moſt Surgeon ſtop the Ears
with Cotton, to prevent his hearing the Noiſe of the Standers by, or the
grating of the Inſtrument. When the Head is conveniently placed, begin the
work by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſmall hole with the Perforative or Piercer, in this ſmall
Hole put the Pin in, to keep the Trepan Stable, which otherwiſe would be apt
to rowl about, and make ſeveral Inciſions with its Teeth. You muſt be
careful to chuſe a Head ſuited to the largeneſs of the Hole you intend to
make; Hold the Handle of the Trepan with the left Hand, and ſupport the
Forehead with the ſame Hand that holds the Trepan, that ſo you may preſs
its Head againſt the Skull, and make the Perforation more commodiouſly; At
firſt turn your Inſtrument very quick. When the Trepan has taken
ſufficient hold take it off, and lay aſide the Pin; for if this continue in
much longer, there will be great danger of piercing the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi>
ſome Skulls being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thin. Cleanſe the Teeth of the Inſtrument
with a little bruſh, every time you take it out, and after place the Crown in
again. Every time you take out the Inſtrument, which is to be done
frequently, you ought to try how deep you have gone, for fear leaſt in
turning it too haſtily round, you endanger a Laceration of the <hi>Dura
Mater</hi> by its Teeth.</p>
                  <p>You muſt likewiſe with a quill cut after the manner of a
Tooth-picker, try the depth of the Perforation in each part of it, that in
caſe it be cut more on one than the other ſide, you may lay the ſtreſs
of the Inſtrument on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite.</p>
                  <p>When you find Blood in the Teeth of the Trepan, you may be
aſſured the Inſtrument has paſt through the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the
Skull, and is arrived at the <hi>Diploe.</hi> When you perceive this, you
muſt turn ſlowly and very cautiouſly, for fear of taking off the firſt
Table, and leaving the ſecond, <pb n="174" facs="tcp:42110:102"/>which Accident makes the
Operation more tedious and troubleſom. When this happens, take out that piece
which is in the Trepan, and continue to cut through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table without
being ſurprized; for the firſt Table is very apt to be broken off after
blows with a blunt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Shock moſt commonly
ſeparates the <hi>Diploe</hi> from the Bone. Try from time to time with the
Myrtle Leaf, whether the piece you are about to take out ſhake, and be near
cut through. This is done to prevent hurting the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which you
muſt inevitably do, if you continue to ſaw the Bone, without ſearching if
it be looſe or not. Some Artiſts uſe the <hi>Terebellum</hi> for this
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but in this Caſe it is neceſſary to have made a way into the
Bone while it is ſtable, before the application of the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. In taking out
the piece which ſhakes, you muſt not attempt to pull it away forcibly, but
remove it gently, for fear of Lacerating the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which
frequently cleaves to it in young Bodies. If the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> adhere to
the Skull, it may be ſeparated with the Myrtle Leaf. Some Practitioners wait
for a Suppuration to ſeparate them, but ſince this happens for the moſt
part only in young Subjects who have the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> ſoft and lax,
the Bone may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently enough be free from it by the <hi>Spatula</hi> or
Myrtle Leaf.</p>
                  <p>When the Piece is removed, there always remain in the bottom
of the Aperture ſeveral little Aſperities, which are to be pared away with
the <hi>Scalper Lenticularis,</hi> or Lenticular Inſtrument Knife (ſo
call'd from a ſmall knob not unlike a Lentil) with which you preſs a little
the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the iſſue of the extravaſated
Blood and <hi>Pus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To evacuate the Blood and <hi>Pus,</hi> place the Patients
Head inclining in ſuch a commodious poſture, that the Matter may make its
way to the Aperture, and then bid the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhut his Mouth and Noſe, and
hold his Breath. Theſe Efforts force the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> to approach
cloſe to the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and drive out the Matter extravaſated on it. This
Riſing of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is effected by the contraction of the
Diaphragm in the Retention of the Breath, which muſt neceſſarily
conſtringe the deſcending Artery paſſing between its Tendons, and by
conſequence drive a great proportion of Blood into the Aſcending Trunk,
which paſſes by the Carotid and Vertebral Arteries into the Brain.</p>
                  <p>The Extravaſated Matter which preſents, muſt be
abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by falſe Tents. If any Blood or <hi>Pus</hi> be lodged under 
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42110:102"/>the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> it muſt be let out with a
Lancet, having an eſpecial care not to Wound the Brain. The Prudent Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
in this Caſe, ought to conceal his Lancet in a falſe Tent, and ſo convey
it in and perform his Work, under pretence of wiping the Membrane.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. In the firſt place, put into the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a
<hi>Sindon</hi> dipt in <hi>Honey of Roſes,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi>
and introduce this between the Skull and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> to humect,
deterge and attenuate the Matter. This <hi>Sindon</hi> is a Rag of very fine
Linen, cut exactly round, through the midſt of which you muſt paſs a
Thread for the drawing it out, in dreſſing of the Wound It muſt be larger
than the Aperture, for the conveying the benefit of the Medicines, with which
it is imbibed to the neighbouring parts, and preſerving the <hi>Dura
Mater</hi> from being hurt by the Aſperities of the Bone, when the Brain is
dilated. Over this <hi>Sindon</hi> apply another arm'd with proper Medicines,
and then fill the remaining part of the Aperture with pledgits dipt in ſome
vulnerary Liquour. Next lay a large Pledgit of dry Lint to cover the Bone, and
between the Lips of the Wound, put in Doſils arm'd with ſome good
Digeſtive made of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and the <hi>Yelks of Eggs,</hi> in the
laſt place cover all with an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter, and keep it on with the Bandage,
called the <hi>Great Cap</hi> for the Head.</p>
                  <p>To make this, Take a large Napkin and fold it length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
unequally, or in ſuch manner that it want three inches of being folded in the
midſt. When you have thus diſpos'd it, take it in the midſt, ſo that
the four Fingers of each Hand be placed under, and both the Thumbs over it, and
bring it behind the Patients Head, and not before, for fear of ſtriking him
over the Face with it. Before you place the Napkin on the Head, bid a Servant
keep the Dreſſings on with his Hands, for fear of throwing them off, or
diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Compreſſes and Emplaſters. Then apply it on the
Forehead; ſo that that part which is three inches longer than the other, may
fall on the Noſe, and bid a Servant hold the two upper ends under the Chin,
or let the Patient do it himſelf if he be able, and do you take the two lower
ends and draw them ſtreight to the ſide of the Head, with both Hands (thus
ſeveral Pleats will be made on the ſide of the Head, reſembling a Gooſe
Foot) then bring theſe two ends behind the Head, and croſſing them there,
pin them where they end. In winding the Napkin round the Head, it forms two
great Sacks or Baggs which fall on the ſides, <pb n="176" facs="tcp:42110:103"/>wherefore
take the two ends which the Servant held in one Hand, and ſlide your other
Hand open into the Baggs, and draw them down, ſo that they may make as few
folds as poſſible, then bring them to the top of the Head, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them
to the leſſer Angles of the Eye. Be careful where they croſs each other
on the top of the Head and behind, to make every thing fit very well, and Pin
them. In the laſt place, tie or pin the two ends which you gave the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to hold under the Chin. When the Dreſſing is thus fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, let the
Patient be laid down, and proceed in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Method for his Cure.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Patient muſt be dreſt twice a day after the
manner above deſcribed, and the parts round the Wound embrocated with <hi>Oyl
of Roſes,</hi> with the addition of a little <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi> But
obſerve here, the Head ought to be ſhaved before the uſe of theſe
Applications. One of the principal cares of the Artiſt ought to be, to
procure a laudable Digeſtion in the External Wound, nothing gives the Patient
greater Relief than this; becauſe the <hi>Dura Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> has a great
Communication with the Teguments, by means of the intervening
Blood-Veſſels. The Patients Chamber muſt be kept in a Temperate warmth,
with a good Fire in it, if the weather be Cold. The Wound muſt never be
opened without a Chaſingdiſh of Coals, and the Curtains drawn cloſe, to
prevent the Air from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting it.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Inflammation of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is ſo
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it forces it ſelf out through the Perforation of the Skull; to
remedy this Accident, you muſt ſtop well the Hole, and have Recourſe to
Bleeding, Clyſters, and a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diet.</p>
                  <p>In Wounds of the Brain and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> there ariſes
ſometimes a <hi>Fungus</hi> or ſoft fleſhy Excreſcences, which are
formed out of the Oyly Subſtance, which abounds in the Brain. When theſe
Tumours happen apply Deſiccatives, as <hi>Spirit of Wine, Tincture of Aloes,
&amp;c.</hi> and ſhun all greaſie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. If theſe fail, uſe the
more mild Cathaereticks, as <hi>Turpentine dryed and powder'd, Powder of</hi>
Iris Florentina, <hi>Burnt Alum;</hi> or laſtly, if theſe are not
ſufficient, <hi>Red pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate.</hi> Obſerve here for the more eaſie
conſuming the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences, the Wound muſt be ſo filled, as to
compreſs them a little.</p>
                  <p>Next after theſe the Decoctions of the Vulnerary Plants
boiled in <hi>White-wine,</hi> with a little <hi>Honey of Roſes,</hi> are to
be <pb n="177" facs="tcp:42110:103"/>commended. In ſhort, Deſiccative or Humecting
Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are proper, according to the different condition of the Wound. But
of whatever kind the Applications are, they ought to be actually hot, and that
to as high a Degree, as the Patient can well endure them.</p>
                  <p>If the Fleſh be firm and ſound, the Surgeon muſt
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep it ſo; but if it be flabby and ſoft, he muſt
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, and apply good Reſolvents.</p>
                  <p>The Pledgits which are laid on to the Bone, ought to be dipt
in ſuch Spirituous Liquors, as promote exfoliation, for which intent Tincture
of <hi>Euphorbium</hi> is excellent.</p>
                  <p>Beſides Local Applications, Internal Medicines muſt be
given as occaſion requires, and the Body always kept open.</p>
                  <p>In all his Dreſſings, a prudent Surgeon muſt be careful
not to uſe foul Cloths, or ſuch as have before been made uſe off in ill
conditioned Sores (as is done in Hoſpitals, where they boyl all the Raggs in
a Lee, and after uſe them again) becauſe there remain in their Pores ſome
Acid Corroſive Spirits, which excoriate and gangrene the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
All Oleous and Acid Medicines are injurious to the Membranes, the firſt,
becauſe they ſtop the Pores, and hinder Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and the laſt,
becauſe they coagulate the Humours, and create Obſtructions.</p>
                  <p>There is no certain time can be aſſigned for the
exfoliation of the Bone, ſometimes it is compleated ſooner, ſometimes
later. The <hi>Callus</hi> which fills the Aperture, is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed
in 40 or 50 Days. It is ſooner perfected in young, than in old Bodies, but is
never ſo firm as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bone.</p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Subject, I ſhall preſent the Reader
with an inſtance out of <hi>Fabricius Hildanus,</hi> of his Proceſs of Cure
in a Fracture of the Skull. This Author tells us, in a certain Caſe, he began
the Cure, by giving the Patient a Clyſter, and after that was come away
ſhaving his Head, and embrocating it with <hi>Oyl of Roſes</hi> and
<hi>Myrtils.</hi> Next he made a Crucial Inciſion, raiſed the Teguments,
cleared the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> laid the Skull bare, and filled the Wound
with fine Tow wetted with the white of an Egg. The next day he removed
ſeveral Fragments which were broke off from the firſt Table, and applyed
the Trepan. And the Patient being in vehement Pain, he laid on the <hi>Dura
Mater</hi> a ſmall Sattin <hi>Sindon,</hi> humected with <hi>Honey</hi> and
<hi>Oyl of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and filled up the Hole with the following
Digeſtive. ℞. <hi>Turpentine waſhed in Sage and Betony Waters,</hi>

                     <hi>Fabr. Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 13. relates
that he had ſeen a Woman who after receiving a Contus'd Wound on the right
Parietal Bone (which was broken and depreſſed by the blow) vomited Bile and
crude Aliments. He took off about 4 fragments of the Bone, and a ſmall
portion of the Brain about the bigneſs of a Bean. The next day he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
more Splinters of the Bone with a Portion of the Brain about the bigneſs of a
Hazel Nut, he continued to take off ſeveral more ſmall Portions of the
Brain, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which the Patient was perfectly cured.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42110:104"/>
                  <p>In the ſame Obſervation he aſſures us, he had ſeen a
Maid wounded on the Head, who had ſeveral large Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bones taken
out, and the <hi>Meninges</hi> being rotten, one ſide of the Brain lay bare.
For the ſpace of three weeks together, the Surgeon was obliged to remove
ſome Portion of it, which Nature ſeparated, ſo that one part of the Brain
was entirely taken out; However it lay thus open, ſeveral Carnous Tubercles
ſprung up on its Subſtance, of which each was as big as a Vetch. Theſe
Tubercles ſenſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, joyned one to another, forming a pretty
ſolid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Tegument, which filled all the Cavity of the Brain, and
covered it, and the Girl in all appearance recovered her Health, but the Cure
of this Wound being neglected, ſhe dyed ſix Months after. That which
occurr'd moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Remark in this Caſe, was, that in the beginning of
this Cure, the Patient did all her ordinary buſineſs about the Houſe, as
if ſhe had been perfectly well, without any Pain or Fever.</p>
                  <p>Some Years agoe, there was in the <hi>Hôtel Dieu</hi> at
<hi>Paris,</hi> a certain Woman who receiving a blow on the Head, the
Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were all corrupted, and a Moiety of the Skull was laid bare. Both
Tables exfoliated, ſo that part of the Frontal Bone, and a Moiety of the two
Parietal Bones came away all at a time; and this Bony Caſe being removed, the
Brain lay bare, and its Motion was very diſcernible. By degrees it was
covered again by a Carnous Matter, which conſolidated, but this Cover never
arrived to ſuch a degree of hardneſs, as to reſiſt the impreſſion
made by the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Brain. Upon the leaſt touch imaginable with the
Finger on this Carnous Membrane, the Woman inſtantly ſeemed to ſee a
thouſand Candles. She had a Cap of Lead made to cover the part, and defend it
from external injuries, and carryed about the exfoliated Bone, as a Cup to
receive Alms in.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author, <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 12.
informs us, he had ſeen a Child of 10 Years of Age, who had a great
Depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Occipital Bone upon a Fall: No dangerous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
appearing at firſt, the Parents neglected the Cure. The Child who before was
very witty, loſt his Memory and Judgment, and was rendred incapable of Study
or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Trade, and at Thirty ſix years of Age, became per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Stupid.</p>
                  <p>He farther relates, that a Child of three Years of Age falling
upon his Forehead, made a Depreſſion large enough <pb n="180" facs="tcp:42110:105"/>to
turn the little Finger in; no other Application was uſed, beſides a
Compreſs dipt in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and renewed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and the
Child was perfectly cured without any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience remaining behind. Theſe
Relations compar'd make it evident, that the Functions of the Soul are not
perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in all parts of the Brain, ſince the depreſſion of the
Occipital Bone in one produced a Stupidity, and yet in the Frontal, the ſame
Accident was attended with no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence prejudicial to the Patient.</p>
                  <p>If Wounds of the Head are attended with extraordinary
Accidents, they ſometimes prove very ſerviceable to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. <hi>F.
Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 8. aſſures us, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Perſon having the <hi>Cranium</hi> fractured at the Concourſe of the
Sagittal and Coronal Suture, by this Wound was cured of a <hi>Vertigo</hi> of
long ſtanding. There remained a ſlight Ulcer on the place of the Fracture,
which perhaps ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected this cure by the diſcharge of Matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sckenkius</hi> tells us, a certain Epileptick Perſon
happening to have a Fracture on the Skull, was by this means cured of a
Diſtemper, with which he had been for many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>

                     <hi>Riverius Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 37. relates the
Hiſtory of a young Girl of 7 years of Age, who for the ſpace of two Months,
had been tormented with ſo violent a Pain in her Head, extending to the
Eye-brows, that ſhe begged to have her Head cut open with a Knife. This
vehement Pain flung her into two or three violent Fits of an Epilepſy to that
degree, ſhe foamed at the Mouth. At length ſhe died, and a great quantity
of <hi>Pus</hi> burſt out of her Noſtrils, which cauſed the Phyſicians
to believe, there was an Abſceſs in the Brain. To diſcover which they
opened the Head, but nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared there, beſides a ſerous Moiſture.
But if theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had opened the Frontal <hi>Sinus,</hi> it is very
probable they would have found an Abſceſs in thoſe Cavities; for moſt
of thoſe Abſceſſes which find an Exit by the Noſe, do not proceed
from the Brain, (ſince there is no paſſage for thence,) but are
diſcharged from the Cavities of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows or Cheeks.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of the</hi> Fiſtula Lachrymalis.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>an Inciſion made near the greater An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of the Eye, to diſcharge the</hi> Pus <hi>in a</hi> Fiſtula <hi>of that
part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Tumour proceeds from a ſharp Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Humour,
which flowing through the Lachrymal Ducts, corrodes and tumefies the ſmall
Caruncle ſeated in the greater Angle of the Eye, from whence it comes to
paſs, that the Tears finding no paſſage into the Cavity of the Noſe,
through the perforations made in the Lachrymal Bone, they muſt of
neceſſity run down the Cheek, while on the other hand, the Acid and
Corroſive parts of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymal Humour, excoriate the Caruncle, and form an
Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which ſoon degenerates into a <hi>Fiſtula.</hi> The Corroſive
Serum is not confined to the Gland, but very often extends its malign effects
farther, and Cariates the Bone, which hapning, makes the Operation abſolutely
neceſſary. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we muſt not imagine that the Lachrymal Humour is
ever the Original of this Malady; for ſometimes there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be an
Abſceſs or Inflammation in the Lachrymal Gland it ſelf, without the
<hi>Lympha's,</hi> being in any manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. When this happens,
there is <hi>Pus</hi> always lodged in it, which is ever diſcharged through
the Noſtrils, when the Patient ſqueezes the place, as moſt commonly they
do once a day, to avoid the Pain and Trouble of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the Patient
be careful to diſcharge the <hi>Pus</hi> in this manner, the Tumour often
do's not encreaſe, and it may remain his whole Life-time, without any notable
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of a <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymalis,</hi> are an
involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flowing of the Tears down the Cheek, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is
no certain proof, ſince a ſimple Obſtruction or Inflammation of the
greater Angle of the Eye, may ſuffice to produce this effect. The infallible
Mark of a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> is a <hi>Pus</hi> flowing out of the corner of
the Eye, or by the Noſe. If the Bone be not corrupted, the Cure may be more
eaſily accompliſhed.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:42110:106"/>
               <p>In Searching to find whether the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> terminate in
the Bone or not, obſerve if there be a hard Subſtance which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
the Probe, without any Pain at all; for in this Caſe it is evident the Bone
is bare, ſince if the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> cover'd it, the Senſe would be
exquiſite, and the Probe cauſe great pain. If the Bone be ſmooth and
even, and the <hi>Pus</hi> which comes away be neither thick nor Oyly, it is a
Mark that it is ſound; on the contrary, if the Bone be rough and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it
is Carious.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Place the Patient in a Chair, and let his Head be kept
ſteddy by a Servant, then bind up the Sound Eye to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ſeeing the
Inſtrument, and make a Semicircular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion with a Knife on the Tumour.
In doing this, be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of cutting the Eye-lids, for this would cauſe a
defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity never after to be removed. Try with the Probe, whither the Bone be
carious in order to dilate the Wound; for if the <hi>Caries</hi> extend beyond
the Inciſion, you muſt open farther with the Lancet, or a Spunge-Tent to
lay the <hi>Caries</hi> bare.</p>
                  <p>If after Inciſion you find the Bone Carious, the Actual
Cautery muſt be applied. When Inuſtion is neceſſary, place a Probe on
the Bone, and on this a <hi>Cannula</hi> or Pipe, which in its upper part is
made after the form of a Tunnel, take out the Probe, and introduce an actual
Cautery into the <hi>Cannula,</hi> and paſs it lightly over the Carioſity.
The uſe of the <hi>Cannula</hi> is to direct the Cautery, and prevent it from
burning the adjacent parts.</p>
                  <p>It is common to pierce the Lachrymal Bone thro' with the
Cautery, but this ſeems to be needleſs; becauſe this Bone being corrupted
by the <hi>Pus</hi> lodged in the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and by the Air and
Medicines applied to it neceſſarily exfoliates, and being very thin comes
away entire, and ſo leaves a hole on the ſide of the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. After the Operation is over, fill the Wound with
ſmall Doſſils of dry Lint, and lay on a dry Pledgit, a ſmall
Emplaſter and Compreſs, and keep on all with the Bandage.</p>
                  <p>The moſt plain and ſimple Bandage, is made with a
Handkerchief folded Diagonalwiſe, or form of Triangle. Take this in both
Hands in the middle with your Thumbs on, and your fingers under it, paſs it
behind the Head, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <pb n="183" facs="tcp:42110:106"/>its middle on the Eye,
ſlide your Hands on the Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief behind the Head, and engage it there
with the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends, which you muſt bring before, pinning them where
they end. This Bandage is proper for all parts of the Head.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of Bandage for the Head, may be made after this
manner. Take a Roller two Ells in length, and an inch and a half broad, apply
the end of the Roller obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely on the Parietal Bone, paſs this over the
part affected, deſcending on the oppoſite Cheek, and ſo paſſing
behind the Head, and then again over the Eye affected, making three rounds in
the ſame manner as the firſt; then bring it ſeveral times round the
Forehead, and laſtly faſten it.</p>
                  <p>If there be occaſion to bind up both Eyes, you muſt
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this manner; take a double-headed Roller an inch and a half broad,
and four Ells in length, apply the Roller behind the Head, then bring each end
of it over each Eye, croſſing it on the Noſe, next deſcending over the
Cheeks, paſs behind the Head, returning on the ſame Rounds of the Roller
made the firſt going about the Head; then bring the two ends of the Roller
about the Forehead, and continue your Rounds about the Head, till the Roller is
ſpent, and then faſten it. Theſe laſt Turns of the Roller about the
Head, ſtay the firſt made on the Eyes.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient lie on his Back, that by this means
the Tears may paſs off by the Orifice that you have made. The Curioſity of
the Bone, and the <hi>Callus</hi> of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> muſt be both
entirely deſtroyed, before the Wound is capable of being cured; and therefore
the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Fleſh muſt be conſumed with ſome effectual
Cauſtick.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> principally conſiſts in
conſuming the <hi>Callus,</hi> and after that is remov'd healing the Ulcer;
for this purpoſe if neceſſity require, you muſt enlarge the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of
the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> by Tents made of <hi>Elder Pith, Roots of
Birthwort,</hi> or <hi>Spunge prepared with Wax.</hi> Dryed <hi>Gentian</hi>
Root alone is good, or the ſame ſmear'd with ſome emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Unguent.
This Root has two good effects, when it is armed with ſome emollient Unguent,
<hi>viz.</hi> It ſoftens the Calloſity, and widens the Mouth of the
<hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and when it is drawn out, is commonly Swoln to twice the
ſize it was when put in. To make this more effectual, you may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtrew on it <hi>Burnt Alum,</hi> by which means you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and conſume
the Calloſities at once.</p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:42110:107"/>
                  <p>When the Calloſities are removed, and the Exfoliation and
Suppuration compleated, cleanſe the Ulcer with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergent Injections made of
<hi>Spirit of Wine, Juyce of Tobacco, the</hi> Exuviae <hi>of Serpents
powder'd, or</hi> Hydromel. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicine is good, ℞. <hi>Honey of

                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. Mix theſe and inject them. The Doſe of
Praecipitate muſt be encreaſed or leſſened, as Circumſtances ſhall
require. <hi>Plantain Water with</hi> Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Dulcis <hi>mixed,</hi> is very
good to make warm Injections with. <hi>Juice of Crabs pounded with Leaves of
Tobacco,</hi> and after preſt out and mixed with <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi>
is an excellent Mundificative; and <hi>Mercury</hi> mixt with Vulneraries, is
one of the beſt Detergents, in the World. The following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine

                  </p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Subject, I ſhall preſent the Reader
with <hi>Hildanus</hi>'s proceſs in curing a <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymalis,</hi>
in the left Eye of a Child of 13 years of Age, which he had had for four years.
This was reputed incurable; for not only the Bone was Carious, but the
Lachrymal Gland was ſo corroded, that the Tears ran plentifully through the
<hi>Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> when the Child cryed, who was very Refractary, and would
not ſuffer the Actual Cautery to be applyed. In the firſt place he
preſcribed a good <hi>Regimen,</hi> purging the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with Medicines
adapted to his Conſtitution. Next he applyed a Seton to his Neck; after the
Seton had diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it ſelf for ſome time, he applyed a Potential
Cautery on the Seton, to enlarge the Orifice, which was very ſtreight. After
the Eſcar was ſeparated, he dilated the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and laid it
open quite to the Bone with an Eſcarotick Unguent, and Spunge Tent, and
filled the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> with powder of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium,</hi> applying
over it an Emplaſter made with <hi>Gum Elemi,</hi> without any other Mixture.
In this manner he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to treat the Patient for ſeven Weeks; after
which the Bone exfoliated; and when this was effected, he put ſome few drops
of good Balſam with Lint into the Wound, which ſoon after healed and the
<hi>Fiſtula</hi> was entirely cured. Sometime after he took off the Seton and
cicatrized the Wound. <hi>Fabr. Hildanus,</hi> ſets a great value on powder
of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium,</hi> in the Cure of <hi>Fiſtula's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42110:107"/>
                  <p>There is another Method of curing theſe
<hi>Fiſtula's,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 6. <hi>Obſ.</hi>
3. He begins the Cure by an exact Diet, then purges off the moſt predominant
Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; Next he fortifies the Head with Medicines, both Internal and
External. The Internal are Decoctions of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacum, Sarſaparilla,
Saſſafras, China, Betony, Sage, Roſemary, Marjoram</hi> and
<hi>Primroſes.</hi> Conſerves of <hi>Betony, Roſemary, Sage, Primroſe,
Piony, Confection of Alkermes, Citron Peel,</hi> and other of the Like
Nature.</p>
                  <p>The External are Powders of <hi>Benzoin,</hi> Styrax Calamita,
<hi>Maſtich,</hi> Olibanum, <hi>White Amber, Grains of</hi> Kermes, <hi>Roots
of</hi> Iris Florentina, <hi>Flowers of Betony, Roſemary, Marjoram, Red
Roſes,</hi> which are to be ſtrewed on the Head, or applied with quilted
Caps.</p>
                  <p>Next he makes revulſion of the Matter, which diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
it ſelf on the Eye; for which purpoſe he commends Cupping-Glaſſes
applied to the Shoulders, and Veſicatories behind the Ears. Setons are of
more uſe ſtill, becauſe they potently attract the Matter, which
otherwiſe would make its way to the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and purge and
ſtrengthen the Head. He aſſures us, Setons are of ſo great importance
in the Cure of Lachrymal <hi>Fiſtula's,</hi> that many times it could not be
effected without their Aſſiſtance. Before the Seton be made, the Body
ought to be very well purged, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ought to run for ſome time,
before you proceed to the Cure of the <hi>Fiſtula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After theſe Preparatives, the Wound muſt be dilated with a
piece of <hi>Gentian Root, prepared Spunge,</hi> or ſome good Cauſtick. The
Patients Eye muſt be kept very cloſe, and very well guarded when
Cauſticks are applied, to prevent their running into it, when they begin to
melt; ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors open <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> with one or two drops of Oyl of
<hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and conſume their Calloſity
with theſe Cauſticks, but this Practice is to be condemned, becauſe the
ſound Bone is corroded, and damaged by theſe Acid Liquors.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is laid open, Doſſils with
<hi>Praecipitate</hi> prepar'd, ought to be put into the Wound, and over them
an Emplaſter with <hi>Gum Elemi.</hi> This Powder muſt be put into the
Wound once or twice a day, according as the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is more or leſs moiſt,
and it is beſt to dreſs it but once a day. It is not convenient at firſt

                  <p>If the Bone be Carious, it muſt be laid bare as far as is
poſſible, and filled with <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> in fine Powder; This is the
beſt Remedy in the World againſt a Carioſity, and there is no reaſon to
apprehend its exceſſive Acrimony, But obſerve here, Powder of
<hi>Euphorbium</hi> is never to be mixed with common Oyl, according to the
abuſive practice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries; for this obtunds its Virtue and Strength,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides common Oyl is injurious to the Bones, as well as the Acid Spirits of

Carioſities of the Bone in Lachrymal <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula's,</hi> make uſe of the

                  <p>When the Ulcer is ſufficiently deterged with Powder of

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>Of Cataracts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>a Punction made in the Globe of the Eye,
with a Needle to depreſs a certain Opake Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Concretion which covers
the Pupil, and hinders the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Rays of Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Authors who pretend to aſſign the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of
Cataracts, differ very much in their Opinions; ſome conceive, they are no
more than an Obſtruction of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, made by the Viſcoſity of the
Aqueous Humour, which is incloſed between the <hi>Cornea</hi> and
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea;</hi> others believe it is a ſmall Webb, ſpread before the
Chryſtalline Humour. Others again imagine it is a ſmall Film, which
ſeparating it ſelf from the Chryſtalline floats in the Aqueous Humour and
are perſwaded that all the Parts are exiſtent in the firſt conformation,
that <hi>Cyſtis's</hi> are never formed <hi>de novo,</hi> but are only
Membranes diſengaged from the Neighbouring parts, which encreaſing in
thickneſs, receive nouriſhment from the parts, to which they adhere. This
Opinion they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to confirm, by obſerving that Cataracts are a Texture
of ſeveral pellicles or thin Films, applied over one another, which may be
eaſily diſcovered when the Cataract is Ripe. They farther pretend to
evince, that a Cataract is only a Membrane diſengaged from the Body of the
Chryſtalline, becauſe if it be depreſſed after it is perfectly formed,
the Chryſtalline Humour is depreſſed together with it. And they endeavour
to perſwade us, that by this means the Rays of Light wanting that due
Modification in the Chryſtalline Humour, which is required for diſtinct
Viſion, all Objects appear confuſed after the Cataract is couched, and the
Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is obliged to wear Spectacles.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. If the Cataract be black, yellow or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it is
for the moſt part incurable. Its thickneſs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeſion, is the
reaſon why in making the Operation, there happens a Laceration of the Pupil,
and this being diſabled from conſtringing and relaxing it ſelf, all the
Rays of Light which enter the Eye, ſtrike on the <hi>Retina</hi> in a
diſorderly manner, and make a confuſed Viſion.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:42110:109"/>
               <p>Blue and Greeniſh Cataracts, or ſuch as are of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Pearl or burniſhed Iron, are Curable by Couching them with the Needle.</p>
               <p>When there is no perceptible Motion in the Pupil, it is a ſign
the Cataract is fixed to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>veà</hi> This is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from
old Cataracts, and ſuch are not to be medled with.</p>
               <p>The way to find whether the Cataract be firm enough to admit of
Operation, is this. Put a Convex-Glaſs, or a Viol of Water before the
Patients Eye, and behind this ſet a lighted Candle. If the Patient can
diſcern any Colours through theſe, it is a ſign the Cataract is not Ripe,
but if he can not, it is time to depreſs it.</p>
               <p>Cataracts hapning after Fevers and violent Headachs, are
difficult to Cure. Cataracts are more eaſily cured in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than in
grown Perſons.</p>
               <p>Cataracts in their beginning, when Objects ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as
through a Cloud, are called Suffuſions. Some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts have the
conſiſtence of Parchment, and theſe have an Elaſtick quality, and when
they, are depreſt ſpring up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, cover the Pupil of the Eye, and
fruſtrate the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When you are well aſſured the Cataract is in a condition
to admit of it, proceed to the Operation. The Spring and Autumn being the
moſt temperate, are for that Reaſon the moſt proper Seaſon for this
purpoſe. When you undertake this, chuſe ſome fine Day, bind up the
Patients ſound Eye, and then place him in a Chair with his Face turned toward
the Light; your ſelf ſitting on a Seat directly before, and ſomething
higher than him, and a Servant being placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to keep his Head on his
Breaſt. When all things are diſpos'd in this manner, bid the Patient turn
the Eye affected towards his Noſe, that ſo the <hi>Tunica Conjunctiva</hi>
may be more apparent. Then take a hafted Needle, ſome of which are Flat,
ſome Round, ſome Three-corner'd, and with this pierce the Conjunctive
Tunick cloſe to the <hi>Cornea,</hi> on the ſame ſide with the leſſer
Angle of the Eye. But obſerve here, carefully to avoid hurting the
Veſſels of the <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi> When the Needle is in, you muſt
boldly thruſt it to the mindle of the Cataract, and keep it depreſt below
the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil. If the Cataract do's not ſpring up again, the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42110:109"/>is well performed; but if it do's riſe, you muſt keep
it down with the Needle, till it is entirely Subjected.</p>
                  <p>The Needle muſt be of well poliſhed Steel, and before you
thruſt it into the Eye, you ought to paſs it through a piece of Woollen
Cloth, or the Brim of a Hat. This ſmoothens it, and takes off any roughneſs
or inequality, which might put the Patient to pain.</p>
                  <p>When the Needle is drawn out, you muſt cloſe the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids,
and not preſent Objects as ſome do, to try if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent can diſcern
them; becauſe the Cataract as yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured in the place where it
is lodged upon the Motion of the Eye, is apt to riſe. Becauſe the too
ſudden ſtriking of the Light on the Filaments of the <hi>Retina</hi> after
a long Diſuſe, muſt inevitably prove hurtful to it, and cauſe
Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. This conſiſts only in applying a Pledgit
dipt in a <hi>Collyrium</hi> made of <hi>Plantane</hi> and
<hi>Roſe-Water,</hi> with the white of an Egg, and over this a Compreſs
kept on with a Handkerchief folded croſs-ways, or any of the Bandages uſed
in the <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymalis,</hi> which have been amply deſcribed in
their proper places. Obſerve that the ſound Eye ought to be bound up to
reſtrain it from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Patient muſt keep his Bed for three or four
Days, after which he may be permitted to riſe and repoſe himſelf in a
Dark Chamber.</p>

this wonderful Accident, ſhut that Eye which had received the Blow, and found
immediately he was in Darkneſs. He next ſhut the ſound Eye, and opened
the other, upon which he found the Chamber, and all the objects illuminated.
Then he called for a Light, but could not bear the ſtrong impreſſion

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of Delivering Women.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>an Extraction of the Child, together with
the Membranes which contain it, and</hi> Placenta, <hi>out of the Mothers
Womb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of a Bigg belly, is the Child contained in the
Womb.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which demonſtrate Conception, are the mutual
Conjunction of the Seed of both Sexes, a more than ordinary pleaſure in the
Act of Coition; becauſe at that time the Neck of the Womb compreſſes the
Yard more ſtreightly, an agreeable Titillation, and leaping in every part of
the Womans Body. However theſe muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted certain Signs, that a
Woman has conceived, ſince we ſee every day, that ſome are impregnated
without emiſſion of Seed, or receiving the leaſt Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>If after Reception of the Male Seed the Womb is cloſe, nothing
comes away, and the Mans Yard is not ſo wet as commonly; this is a ſign
that there is a Conception, and that the Maſculine Seed is retained in the
Womb.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42110:110"/>
               <p>A Woman after Conception, feels ſome ſmall pain round about
the Navel, and ſome working in the lower Belly, which ariſes from a
ſtrong Contraction of the Womb, when it cloſes it ſelf, which creating a
Motion in the Bladder, draws down the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus,</hi> which terminates in
the Navel, and this creates a little pain in that part. This Commotion of the
lower Belly proceeds, from the Irritation of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> by the Motion
of the Womb which lies on, and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to it.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that the Internal Orifice of the Womb in
Women who have had Children, is not ſo exactly cloſed in the time of
Conception, as in Women who never had a Child.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nauſea,</hi> the loſs of Appetite without any
viſible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, a longing after odd and uncommon things, Sickneſs and
Vomiting continuing for a long time together, Liſtleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Dozineſs,
Frowardneſs, and ill Humour without a Reaſon, Pains in the Teeth, to which
ſhe was not ſubject before; extraordinary Spitting, Retention of the
Courſes, or Evacuation of them at an unuſual time, Riſing of the
Breaſts, a Hardneſs and Pain in them, the Nipple growing hard, and
encreaſing in bigneſs a little (becauſe of the Repletion) the
encreaſing of the little Circle, its brown Colour, the Protuberance of the
Navil, the ſoftneſs and laxity of the Eye-lids, which are difficulty kept
open, their heavy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect with a Yellow Livid Circle round them, the Eyes
ſunk, their Whites Turbid, a Languiſhing look, the Blood let out bad,
Emaciation, a Big belly which gradually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, all theſe after Coition
are ſigns of Conception, all which ſometimes appear at once, and
ſometimes only part of them.</p>
               <p>The Reader ought here to obſerve, that ſeveral of theſe
Signs happen to Maids in a Retention of their Courſes; as for inſtance
<hi>Nauſea,</hi> Vomiting, though not ſo frequently, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, Hardneſs
and Pain in the Breaſt and Belly, Appetite to odd and uncommon Things, livid
Eyes, their Womb may be cloſed. On the contrary, Women may ſometimes have
their Courſes the whole time of their going with Child, but not in ſo great
plenty as at other times.</p>

                  <head>Of the Signs which precede, and accompany a Natural
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</head>
                  <p>Sometimes the Life of the Mother, as well as that of 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42110:111"/>her Child, is endangered by haſtning her Delivery,
before the Term of her going with Child is compleated.</p>
                  <p>Colick Pains ariſing from Wind impriſoned, and moving to
and fro in the lower Belly, which rufling up and down, are not directed to the
lower part of the Womb, (as all Throes in a true Labour,) are no Signs that a
Woman ought to be Delivered. Theſe Colick Pains are diſperſed by warm
Cloths applyed to the Belly, or Carminative Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whereas theſe
augment the Pains in Real Labour. Theſe counterfeit Pains, may ſometimes
proceed from a Diarrhaea, or the Paroxyſm of a Fever.</p>
                  <p>The true Signs which precede a Natural Labour, and happen
within a few Days before, are unuſual Pains in the Reins, the Riſing of the
Belly which was above falls down, which makes the Woman walk with more
difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than before, and Stimulates her to Urine, becauſe the
<hi>Foetus</hi> bears down on the Bladder; Laſtly, a Flux of Glai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Humour
from the Womb which humects the Parts, and dilates the paſſage of the
Infant.</p>
                  <p>The Signs which accompany Labour, are great Pains in the Back
and Reins, which redoubling by Intervals, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate at the bottom of the Belly
with repeated Throes. The Woman has a fuller, quicker, and higher Pulſe than
ordinary; Her Face is Red, and inflamed by the vehement efforts ſhe makes to
help the Birth. The Natural parts are tumefied, becauſe the Infant
ſtruggles to get out; and if Vomiting Supervene, it is a ſign that the
Child will ſoon be born. This Vomiting ariſes from a certain Sympathy,
between the Womb and Stomach, becauſe of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Nerves between
thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>When the Delivery is near, there happens a Univerſal
Trembling, eſpecially in the Thighs and Hamms, a general Heat, and the
Humours which then come away, are often tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Blood. The Internal
Orifice of the Womb is open, which may be felt with the Finger, and the
Membranes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Foetus</hi> preſent themſelves; Theſe
appear harder and tenſer, according as the Pain is more or leſs Vehement.
The Pains continuing the Membranes break, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters come away, and the
Naked Head of the Child preſents it ſelf to the Orifice.</p>
                  <p>When all or moſt of theſe Signs appear, it is certain that
the Woman is near her Delivery, whether ſhe have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated her Term or
not.</p>

               <div type="operation">
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:42110:111"/>
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When you perceive by the abovementioned Signs, that a Woman is
really in Labour, take care that neither her Cloaths, or any thing elſe be
about her Belly, which may ſtreighten it; and give her ſome pretty ſtrong
Clyſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Child be in the paſſage, to evacuate the
<hi>Rectum,</hi> and provoke the Woman to go to Stool. After this make a Bed
for her, if it be Winter near the Fire. The Bed ought to be ſo placed, that
you may commodiouſly go round it.</p>
                  <p>If the Woman be full of Blood, take away ſome of it when the
Pulſe riſes. This practice is uſeful to free the Breaſt, to
aſſiſt Reſpiration, and prevent a great loſs of Blood or Fever after
her Delivery. Then let her take ſome good Broth, or a new laid Egg, and let
her walk in her Chamber, and from time to time take a Spoonful or two of Wine
not too ſtrong, becauſe all Heady Wines, and ſtrong Liquours, are apt to
kindle a Fever. When her Pains take her, adviſe her to help her Throes.</p>
                  <p>The Artiſt ought from time to time, to feel the internal
Orifice of the Womb, to diſcover whether the Waters are not ready to break,
which ſo ſoon as he perceives, he muſt anoint the Parts with ſome
Emollient Oyl or Greaſe, and keep near the Patient to obſerve all her
Motions, Complaints, and Pains, to make a Judgment whether her Delivery be
near, without being obliged ſo often to try the Parts. Let the Patient ever
and anon reſt on her Bed to recruit her ſtrength, but ſhe muſt not be
ſuffered to lie on it too long, eſpecially if it be a low Pallet-Bed,
becauſe by Walking, the Weight of the Infant dilates the Internal Orifice of
the Womb, and the Pains are more vehement and frequent; on the other Hand,
ſhe muſt not be too much Fatigued in her firſt Pains, for fear her
ſtrength be exhauſted too ſoon.</p>
                  <p>When the Waters preſent, let them break of themſelves if
the Labour be Natural, becauſe if you ſhould break them before her
Delivery, the paſſage would be dry, and more difficult for the Infant to
ſlip through. After the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are broken, introduce the Finger into the
internal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Womb, to try if the Head of the Child pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it
ſelf, which may be known if it be Hard, Thick, Round, Heavy, and equal, for
all other parts would be rough and unequal, Hard or Soft, according as they
differ.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:42110:112"/>
                  <p>For the delivering the Woman, place her on a Bed covered with
a Quilt, and not a Feather-Bed, with Linen ſeveral times doubled, to receive
the Blood and Waters (which come in great abundance from her) and prevent their
incommoding her. The moſt convenient Poſture to place her in, is on her
Back, with her Head and Breaſt a little raiſed, ſo that ſhe be neither
lying nor ſitting; for in this manner ſhe will be able to breath more
eaſily, and have more ſtrength to help her Pains, than if ſhe were
otherwiſe, or ſunk in her Bed. Being thus placed, ſhe muſt ſpread her
Thighs abroad, fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Leggs a little toward her Buttocks, which muſt be
raiſed by a ſmall Pillow underneath, to the end that the <hi>Coccyx</hi> or
Rump-bone may give back; laſtly, ſhe muſt have her feet ſtayed
againſt ſome firm Thing, and hold ſome of the Aſſiſtants by the
Hand, that ſhe may better ſtay her ſelf during her Pains. The Woman
muſt be encouraged to hold her Breath, and bear down her Pains as well and as
ſtrongly as ſhe can. Here I muſt condemn the Practiſe of ſome
Midwifes, who preſs the Superiour parts of the Belly, to thruſt the Child
gently down: This bruiſes the Womb, and hinders the Delivery. The Artiſt
ought to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (having, firſt Anointed his Hand with ſome Oyls
or Greaſes) to dilate the inner Orifice of the Womb, putting his Fingers up
into its entry, and ſpreading them in the time of her Pains, thruſting by
little and little the ſides of the Orifice, towards the hinder part of the
Childs Head.</p>
                  <p>When the Head begins to advance, the Artiſt muſt ſeat
himſelf conveniently to receive the Child, and with his Fingers ends
endeavour to put back the inner Orifice of the Womb over its Head, and as
ſoon as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as far as the Ears, or thereabouts, take hold of the
two ſides with his Hands, ſlipping his Fingers under the Jaws, and upon the
firſt great Pain which comes, draw it forth. Here let him take great care
that the Navel-ſtring be not entangled about the Neck, or any other Part,
leaſt thereby the After burthen be pulled with Violence, and with it the Womb
to which it is faſtned, and ſo it cauſe a Flooding, or break the
ſtring. It muſt alſo be obſerved, that the Head be not drawn forth

being paſt, the Child be ſtopt by the bigneſs and largeneſs of the
Shoulders, and ſo be Suffocated in the paſſage. As ſoon as the Head is
born, he may ſlide his Fingers under the Armpits, and draw out the reſt of
the Body.</p>

                  <p>When the Child is drawn forth, place it on its ſide with its
Face towards you, leaſt the Blood and Waters which follow immediately after,
ſhould incommode it, or it may choak it by running into its Mouth or Noſe,
as they would do if it were laid on its Back.</p>
                  <p>If the Womans Pains continue after the Birth, and her Belly be
big, and putting your Hand into her Body, you find another gathering of the
Waters, it is a ſign there is a Child ſtill remaining in the Womb. If this
be ſo, you muſt not endeavour to fetch away the After-birth, till the
Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be delivered of all her Children (becauſe Twins ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have but one
Burthen, to which there are faſtned as many diſtinct Strings and Membranes,
as there are Children) and if it ſhould be drawn forth after the Birth of the
firſt, the reſt would run a Risk of loſing their Lives, and beſides it
would endanger a Flooding.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon let the firſt ſtring be cut (being
firſt tyed with a Thread three or four times double) and faſten the other
end with a Thred to the Womans Thigh, to prevent the inconvenience it may
cauſe, by hanging between her Legs; and when this is done, break the
Membranes of the Child which remains in the Womb to let out the Waters, and
draw it out of the Mothers Body, obſerving the ſame Circumſtances as in
the firſt, after which fetch away the Afterbirth in the following manner.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>How to fetch away the After-burthen.</head>
                     <p>When the Child is born the Artiſt taking the String,
muſt wind it once or twice about one or two Fingers of his left Hand (for
inſtance, the Fore and Middle Finger joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) the better to hold it,
or he may take it in his left Hand, wrapping it in dry Linen, to prevent it
from ſlipping between his Fingers; having done this, let him draw it
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and with the right Hand take another hold of it above the left
near the Privities, drawing likewiſe with that very gently, reſting the
while the forefinger of the ſame Hand extended, and ſtretched forth along
the String towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> always obſerving to
draw it from that ſide where the Burthen cleaves leaſt. In performing this,
he muſt avoid the Membranes of the Infant, which ſometimes hang out after
the Birth, and inveſting the String hinder him from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Firm. But
above all things, let him be careful to draw the Burthen gently, for fear of
breaking the String, <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42110:113"/>or drawing down the Womb with it, or
cauſing a Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which would be of dangerous conſequence. In the mean
time the Woman may blow ſtrongly into her Hands ſhut, or ſtop her
Noſtrils, or ſhe may put her Finger into her Throat, as if ſhe would
excite Vomiting, or elſe ſtrive as if ſhe were going to ſtool, bearing
down and holding her Breath, all which Motions have the ſame effect, and
ſerve to looſen the Burthen, and facilitate its expulſion. If this do not
ſuffice, after you know on which ſide the After-birth is ſituated, bid an
experienced Nurſe-keeper preſs the Belly lightly with the flat of her Hand,
bringing it gently down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by way of Friction: When the Burthen is come
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it muſt be conſidered whether it be entire, and if the leaſt part
remain behind, ſo much as the Skirts or any Clods of Blood, the Hand muſt
be put up into the Womb to bring them out.</p>
                     <p>When the String is broke and the <hi>Placenta</hi> is
retained, you muſt ſpeedily introduce your Hand into the Womans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and
before the Womb can cloſe (having firſt anointed it with ſome Greaſe or
Oyl, and pared your Nails cloſe) bring it away. This is eaſie to be done,
if it do's not cleave to the Womb; but if it do's adhere, you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinguiſh it from the Womb it ſelf, by the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities in
its Surface, and then by trying with your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on which ſide it cleaves
leaſt, begin to diſingage it there, thruſting the end of your Fingers
between it and the Womb, continuing ſo to do till it be entirely freed, and
then gently draw it out. You ought to be careful in ſeparating the Burthen,
to avoid ſcratching the Womb, for fear of a Flooding, Inflammation or
Gangrene, and it is better to leave ſome part of it behind, than endanger
ſuch Accidents.</p>
                     <p>If the Womb be not open enough to receive the Hand, anoint
the Womans Privities, and introduce two or three Fingers, with which apprehend
that Portion of the Burthen, which almoſt always preſents it ſelf at the
internal Orifice, and draw it gently, and a little obliquely on one ſide and
the other, and ſo proceed forwards, keeping what you firſt ſeized in its
Membranes.</p>
                     <p>If all theſe Methods fail, and you cannot fetch it then
away, you muſt have recourſe to Injections made with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions of
<hi>Mallows, Marſhmallows, Pellitory, Linſeed,</hi> with the addition of
<hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Lilies,</hi> or a bit of <hi>freſh Butter,</hi>
theſe injected into the Womb are proper to <pb n="197" facs="tcp:42110:113"/>ſuppurate,
and ſo bring it away. Strong Clyſters are very Serviceable, becauſe the
Patients ſtriving to go to Stool, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much aſſiſts the expulſion of
the Burthen.</p>
                     <p>Bleeding in the Foot or Arm is neceſſary as occaſion
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to prevent a Fever; but if the Woman be free from it, good
Reſtoratives may be given her, as Broths made of Veal or Poultry, with a
little Juyce of Orange, or Wine and Water.</p>

and finds the Infant ſtir within her.</p>
                     <p>If you doubt whether the Child be alive after the Waters are
broke, paſs your Hand gently up into the Womb, and take hold of the String as

                     <p>You may conclude the Child to be Dead, if he has not

your Finger along the Leg and Thigh to the Twiſt, till you find the two

taking them with both Hands above the Ancles, and holding them cloſe
together, draw them till the Thighs and Hamms of the Child are come forth; as
ſoon as the Knees are come out, take hold of the Thighs above them, wrapping

the Child to the upper part of the Breaſt. Then bring down the two Arms of
the Child on the ſides of the Body, taking hold of his Hands near the

Face be downwards, to prevent the Chin from ſtopping on the Sharebone;

Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Members, or any regular or certain Figure, Moles have no
Burthen or Navel-ſtring, but adhere to the VVomb, and draw Nouriſhment from
it, and are ſometimes contained in Membranes. If VVomen caſt them before
the ſecond or third Month, they are commonly called falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and
Moles if they are retained in the VVomb for a longer time and grow larger.</p>
                     <p>There is little difference in the Signs to enable us to
diſtinguiſh between a Mole and falſe Conception; except that the Belly in
VVomen who have Moles, is harder and more painful, and appears equally extended
on all ſides, not riſing to a point before, and tumefies ſooner than if
ſhe were really with Child. Moles are void of Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not
encompaſt with VVaters, and attended with more inconveniences, than a Natural
Conception, and the VVoman has no Milk in her Breaſts, tho ſhe can preſs
ſome Seroſities out of them.</p>
                     <p>VVhen you are aſſured the Big belly do's only proceed
from a Mole, try to bring it away as ſoon as is poſſible, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
Patient ſome Purgative Medicines, in caſe there be no Fever or Flooding;
and when theſe begin to operate, give a ſharp Clyſter to excite her
Throes, and when the VVomb begins to dilate, relax it with Greaſe and
Emollient Oyls. Bleeding in the Feet, and half Baths are very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in
this caſe.</p>
                     <p>If a Mole be not too large, or adhere too firmly to the
VVomb, it will come away without the Aſſiſtance of any Remedies; but if
it cleave ſtrongly, or be exceeding large, when the VVomb is ſufficiently
dilated, the Artiſt muſt ſlide in his Hand and fetch it out, or make
uſe of a Crotchet or ſometimes a Knife, to divide it into pieces.</p>
                     <p>If the Mole cleave to the VVomb, he muſt ſeparate it
from the part with his Fingers, which he muſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees inſinuate between
them, beginning in that place where it adheres leaſt, and proceeding till it
be entirely looſned, having great care to have his Nails pared cloſe, for
fear of hurting the VVomb.</p>
                     <p>If it be a Falſe Conception, ſlide one Finger into the
VVomb, and bend it on one ſide and another, till you can enter a Second and a
Third, or a Fourth, and then taking <pb n="209" facs="tcp:42110:119"/>it between the
Fingers, fetch it away together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted Blood; and if no Portion
happen to remain behind, the Flux of Blood will ſoon ceaſe. But if the
Orifice be ſo ſmall, that the Artiſt cannot poſſibly introduce more
than one Finger, let that be the Fore-finger of the Right Hand, and let him
thruſt that as far as he can, and turn it about to looſen the Falſe
Conception from the VVomb, and bring it away with the Finger; and if he cannot
do this, let him make Injections into the Womb to ſuppurate it. The Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will undoubtedly ceaſe, if no part of the Conception be left behind: But if
the Internal Oriſice cannot be more dilated than is mentioned, and the
Flooding be ſo violent as to endanger the Womans Life, the Artiſt having
introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Fore-finger of his Left Hand, muſt take with his Right a

Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or long Abſtinence is hurtful, becauſe it heats the Blood, and
conveys ill Nouriſhment to the Child, which renders it weak, and decayd, and
often makes it ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to free it ſelf before its time, and ſeek for
better Food. On the contrary ſhe muſt not eat too great quantity of Meat,
eſpecially at Night, becauſe the Womb in the laſt Months of going with
Child poſſeſſes a great part of the capacity of the lower Belly, and
hinders the Stomach from retaining much; and hence when it is overcharged, it
cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Belches, Indigeſtion, and difficulty of Breathing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from
a compreſſion of the Diaphragm, which wants liberty of Motion. Let her

have it coold with Ice, or any otherwiſe drink it too cold, for cool Liquors
are apt to breed the Colick, and by conſequence endanger Abortion. On the

Salt, Sharp, Bitter, Aperitive and Diuretick things, which provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the
Courſes, are apt to make a VVoman miſcarry.</p>

                     <p>VVomen with Child muſt have moderate Sleep, that is eight
Hours at leaſt, and ten at the moſt in the Nighttime, and little or none at
all in the Daytime. However VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are uſed to ſleep in time Daytime,
muſt be indulged in this bad cuſtom, rather than do violence to Nature in
breaking an ill habit too abruptly.</p>
                     <p>As for Exerciſe and Reſt, theſe differ according to
the times of Pregnancy. For the firſt four or five Days after Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a
VVoman ought to keep her ſelf in Bed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the embraces of her
Husband. During all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time of her going with Child, ſhe muſt
uſe no violent exerciſe, muſt not go in any Coach, Chariot, or on
Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, becauſe theſe Agitations of the Body are apt to loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the
<hi>Foetus,</hi> and if ſhe have occaſion to go abroad, it muſt be in a
Chair or Litter. She muſt not carry any great Burthen, or lift her Arm too
high; and for this reaſon ſhe ought not to dreſs her own Head. The
lifting of the Hands has cauſed many Abortions, becauſe the Ligaments of
the Womb are relaxed by theſe violent extenſions. Her ſhooes ought to be
lowheeld, becauſe the Riſing of her Belly hindring her from ſeeing her
Feet, ſhe is apt to fall.</p>
                     <p>If a VVoman happens to ſtumble, fall or hurt her Belly by
any other Accident, and ſhe find her ſelf to void Blood, or a Bloody
<hi>Serum,</hi> or indeed any VVater from the Womb, let her repoſe her ſelf
ſome Days without ſeeing her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, till theſe evacuations ceaſe,
and ſhe find no pain in the Reins or Bladder.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, ſhe muſt govern her ſelf ſo in all
exerciſes, as to exceed in too much Reſt rather than Motion, becauſe a
much greater danger attends the one than the other; and <pb n="214" facs="tcp:42110:122"/>when ever a VVoman is adviſed to uſe exerciſe to facilirate her
Delivery, it muſt ever be underſtood to be very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. A VVoman with
Child ought to abſtain from the embraces of her Husband, the two laſt
Months before her Term, becauſe in theſe Careſſes, there is a great
Agitation of the Body and Compreſſion of the Belly, which often
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a wrong Poſture of the Child. A VVoman with Child ought to have
a preſence of Mind, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared againſt all Surprizes which may
happen, as Claps of Thunder, Firing of Canon, and other ſudden Noiſes,
which Reſolution is difficult to be obtained.</p>
                     <p>VVomen with Child are ſubject to a Conſtriction of the
Belly, becauſe the <hi>Foetus</hi> preſſes on the <hi>Rectum,</hi> and
hinders a free diſcharge of the Excrements; beſides there is uſually in
VVomen with Child a certain Heat of the Bowels, which diſpoſes them to
Coſtiveneſs. Let a VVoman who is ſubject to this inconvenience eat
<hi>Boyl'd Apples, Stew'd Prunes, New Figgs, Mulberries, Honey with Bread, Rye

are laid is full of VVrinkles, becauſe the Skin not having liberty to extend
it ſelf on all ſides, forces its way <pb n="215" facs="tcp:42110:122"/>towards the
Thighs, where being exceedingly ſtretched, it can never after regain its

have their Clothes looſe without Buskins which compreſs the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the

                     <head>Of Vomiting in Women with Child.</head>
                     <p>A VVoman has moſt commonly an inclination to Vomit in the
beginning of her Pregnancy, and at ſuch times there is no great
apprehenſions; but if this continue it weakens the Stomach exceedingly, and
it is more apt to corrupt, than digeſt the Food. Theſe Vomitings continue
till the third or fourth Month, which is the time the Child ſtirs moſt.
After that time VVomen uſually begin to regain that Appetite which they had
loſt the firſt Months, and this ſeems neceſſary, becauſe the Child
growing greater, requires a larger ſupply of Nouriſhment. Sometimes the
Vomiting perſiſts, and then the VVoman is in great danger of
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying, becauſe theſe Commotions throw the <hi>Foetus</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the VVomb downwards. Some Women are more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with this Accident in
the latter Months, than in the firſt, becauſe the Stomach is compreſſed
by the diſtention of the VVomb. This Vomiting when it happens to VVomen
whoſe Children lie high, do's not ceaſe till their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>You need not be concerned if a VVoman Vomits in her firſt
going with Child, if this be not attended with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtraining,
but if it perſiſt after the fourth Month, ſome Remedy muſt be uſed;
becauſe the <hi>Foetus</hi> growing large, requires Nouriſhment as well as
the Mother, and muſt neceſſarily be deprived of it, if ſhe continues to
caſt it up, beſides the commotion of the Body endangers an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion, or a
Deſcent of the VVomb.</p>
                     <p>This Vomiting cannot be ſtopt of a ſudden, but muſt be
abated and checked by degrees, by taking good Suſtenance, and eating but a
little at a time, becauſe the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repell'd by the VVomb, the Meat
regurgitates. To this <pb n="216" facs="tcp:42110:123"/>end let the Patient make her Meat
palatable with <hi>Juyce of Oranges, Limons, Pomgranats,</hi> or a little
<hi>Verjuice</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar,</hi> as her Appetite ſerves. She may take
often a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction made of <hi>Flower of Barley,</hi> firſt baked a little in
an Oven, and then mixed with <hi>Yelks of Eggs,</hi> to make it more
Nouriſhing and eaſie of Digeſtion. She may likewiſe eat after her

Gooſberries,</hi> and drink ſome old <hi>Red Wine</hi> mixt with <hi>Spring
Water,</hi> or in want of that clear <hi>River Water with Iron quencht in

and excite Vomiting, and ſo do all things which are ſweet and prepared with

                     <p>If notwithſtanding the Woman continues to Vomit, it is

from its Bottom, as may be diſcovered, if trying with a Finger if the
Internal Orifice be <pb n="224" facs="tcp:42110:127"/>exactly cloſed, which could not be
if the Blood come from the bottom of the Womb; to all which add, if it be the

                     <p>Theſe Oedematous Tumours are not very dangerous, when they
are without Fever; but when they proceed from an Inflammation attended with a

                     <p>Sometimes there are varicoſe Swellings on the Lips of the

                     <p>If a Woman be delivered before her ſeventh Month, it is
called an Abortion, but if at any time after the beginning of that, to the
beginning of the tenth Month it is called a Birth, becauſe at that time the
Child can live, and never before it.</p>
                     <p>All acute Diſtempers cauſe an Abortion, becauſe they
kill the Child, and then it can remain no longer in the Womb. Intermitting
Fevers ſometimes make a Woman Miſcarry, by cauſing a great pain in the
Belly, and diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Child, which commonly ſtruggles very much in
the time of the Fit. There are ſeveral Accidents which endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger an Abortion,
ſuch as are great Vomitings, which by the ſtraining of the parts,
compreſs the Womb, and force it to disburthen it ſelf. Nephritick Pains,
Colick and Griping of the Guts, Stranguries when the Woman labours much in
making water, Great Looſneſs with a <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> abundance of the
Courſes from the opening of the Womb, exceſſive Bleeding, Flooding from a
looſning of the <hi>Placenta,</hi> Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Womb; in ſhort,
whatever makes a great Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Concuſſion of the Womans Body, as hard

Laughing, Blows over the Belly, ſudden and ſurprizing Noiſe upon firing a
Cannon or a clap of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, eſpecially in the younger ſort, long Watching
which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the Strength, long Abſtinence which weakens both Mother and
Child, Stinks and ill Smells, as a Lamp of Oyl extinguiſhed or the fume of
Charcoal, the Calloſity of the Womb, or its ſmallneſs which being

Reception of the Child, Compreſſion of the Womb by ſtrait lacing the Body
to appear well ſhaped or conceal a big Belly, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Copulation,
eſpecially in the laſt Months, which opens the Womb. Flegmatick Women
ſubject to the Whites are apt to Miſcarry, becauſe the Womb is moiſt
and lax, and <pb n="230" facs="tcp:42110:130"/>the <hi>Placenta</hi> eaſily ſeparates.
The great abundance of Blood which is carried to the <hi>Foetus</hi> too
plentifully ſometimes, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focates it. Vehement Rage which puts the Spirits
into a great Hurry and Diſorder, ſudden Fear or the Relation of bad News,
often cauſe a Woman to Miſcarry on the Spot. When Children are Monſtrous,
they never come at their due time. The ill Poſture of the Child in the Womb
ſometimes puts him on ſtrugling, which looſens the <hi>Placenta,</hi> and
opens the Womb. In the laſt place, Children are ſometimes ſo large, that
the Womb is not capacious enough to contain them, or the Mother able to give
them Nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>If after any of theſe Accidents, a Woman have violent
Pains in her Belly and Reins, clods of Blood come away from the Womb, and the
Waters are broke, it is certain an Abortion is near. If the Woman feel a great
Weight in her Belly, and the Child fall as a Ball on which ſide ſoever
ſhe lie, and ſtinking Humours come from the Womb, ſhe will Miſcarry of
a dead Child; eſpecially if the Breaſts, which before were hard and full,
fall and decay. We have above directed how to prevent theſe kinds of
Abortions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall remit the Reader thither.</p>
                     <p>A Woman who is ſubject to Miſcarry ought to keep her
Bed, uſe a good Diet, and refrain from Copulation, ſo ſoon as ſhe
perceives her ſelf with Child, avoiding all Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Aperitives, and
all Paſſions of Mind, go looſe in her Dreſs, wear low-heel'd Shooes,
and take care not to ſtumble. When a Woman with Child happens to receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Arm, without deferring it as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>

Nature ſtriving with its utmoſt efforts to expel any extraneous Body,
breaks the Veſſels, and pours a Torrent of blood out of them. Sometimes
Seroſities only flow from the Womb, and the Standers by are inclined to
believe the Flooding is ſtopt, when indeed the Mouths of the Veſſels are

conſiderable time. The firſt Courſes which come after Flooding are very
plentiful, and in greater quantity than uſual, which makes the Woman fear the

                     <head>Of the falling out of the Womb after Delivery.</head>
                     <p>When there is a falling out of the Womb, the Woman feels a
great weight at the bottom of her Belly, great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in making Water, a
Pain in her Reins and Back, and a Reddiſh Water comes away from the Neck of
the Womb, which is relaxed and hangs out.</p>
                     <p>To remedy this indiſpoſition, let the Neck of the Womb
be forthwith reduced to its Natural place, and if the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be young, and the
Diſeaſe be recent, ſhe may be cured, <pb n="237" facs="tcp:42110:133"/>but if it be
of long ſtanding, the Cure will be difficult to perform. If the Womb come
quite forth upon a Womans delivery, and be not immediately reduced, her life is
in very great danger. When this happens, the Artiſt muſt have a care not to
miſtake that large portion of Fleſh which hangs between the Thighs for
ſome extraneous Body, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Neck of the Womb it ſelf, which has
loſt its Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſities by its Relaxation. If he draws this, there is great
Danger of cauſing a Flooding, and killing the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                     <p>For the curing of this Diſeaſe, it is neceſſary to
reduce the Womb to its Natural place, and retain it there. To do this let the
Woman make Water, having firſt to facilitate the Work given her Clyſters to
evacuate the groſs Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the <hi>Rectum,</hi> then let her lie on
her back with her Hips raiſed higher than her Head, and foment with
<hi>Milk</hi> or <hi>Wine</hi> luke-warm, that which hangs out between her
Thighs, and take the Neck of the Womb with a ſoft Rag, and reduce it to its
Natural place, thruſting it with the Hand ſometimes on one ſide,
ſometimes on the other. If the Neck of the Womb be ſo large that it cannot
enter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it with <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almond,</hi> to put it up the more
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily; and when it is reduced, wipe of the Oyl for fear it relax the part,
and occaſion its falling out again. If the Womb cannot be reduced, there is
great danger of its gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grening, and killing the Woman.</p>
                     <p>When the Womb is replaced, let the Woman be laid on her
back, with her Hips a little raiſed, and her Legs croſſed, and her Thighs
cloſe to each other, for fear of its falling out again, and put a Peſſary
into the Neck of the Womb to keep it there. Theſe Peſſaries are made of a
thick piece of Cork covered with white wax to preſerve them from rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and keep them from hurting the Neck of the Womb, and may be drawn out from time
to time to cleanſe them; The Reader will find the Figure of them in the
Plates an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed at the end.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the Cleanſings continue, there is no other way to
ſtrengthen the Womb, and keep it in its proper place, but by Peſſaries,
for Aſtringent Medicines ſuppreſs thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and are of
dangerous conſequence, and compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Belly by Swathing it, forces
the Womb ſtill down. Let the Patient have the Pan given her in Bed, and in
void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Excrements, let her lay her Hand before to keep the Womb from
falling out. When the Cleanſings are over, <pb n="238" facs="tcp:42110:134"/>Aſtringent
Injections may be uſed, and the Peſſary covered with Medicines of the
like Nature, and the Woman be purged if occaſion require. If ſhe be newly
delivered, ſhe muſt not riſe from her Bed in ſix or ſeven Weeks,
during which time ſhe muſt refrain from the Embraces of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

                     <p>The great Dilatation of the Privities which is made by the
Child in making its way out, cannot fail of ſometimes making Contuſions and
Lacerations, and if theſe Accidents are neglected, they degenerate into
malignant Ulcers, by <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42110:134"/>reaſon of the continual Heat and

there is nothing farther neceſſary than the applying a Cataplaſm made of

                     <p>Sometimes Midwives do ſo much violence to the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>Sometimes the <hi>Perineum</hi> happens to be rent quite
down to the Fundament in the Birth, ſo that the <hi>Anus</hi> and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
make but one common Hole. If this were left in this State, the Woman would be
delivered with more eaſe of her next Child; but notwithſtanding it is
better to reunite the parts as ſoon as may be, becauſe the Excrements
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way diſguſt the Husband, and the Woman is by no means fit to

                     <p>Wherefore having cleanſed the Part with <hi>Red Wine</hi>
luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, let the Rent be ſtitched with three or four ſeparate Stitches,

the Excrements from falling on it, which would cauſe a great deal of Pain,

                     <p>If ſhe afterwards happen to be with Child, let her take

                     <p>If the Re-union of the Wound be neglected at firſt, the

                     <p>If the Child ſtop too long in the paſſage, there is a

                     <head>Of Pains hapning to Women after Delivery.</head>
                     <p>After a Woman is delivered, ſhe ordinarily is troubled
with ſharp Pains in the Reins, Back, Groins, and ſometimes in the Womb, and
all over the Belly. Theſe Pains are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Continual, and ſometimes
Intermitting, and proceed from wind in the Guts, or ſome extraneous Body
remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Womb after Delivery, which Nature ſtrives to expel with her
utmoſt efforts. Some falſe Conception, ſome portion of Burthen, or ſome
Clods of Blood in the Womb, may be the cauſe of theſe After-pains, which
ceaſe not till they are ejected, and are not like the Wind-Cholick
alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by giving of Clyſters, but rather exaſperated.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes theſe Pains proceed from a ſudden
Suppreſſion of the Cleanſings, and then the Womb is diſtended and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, the Belly is hard and Swoln, and the Woman is quickly killed by
it.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes theſe Pains ariſe from an Exceſſive
Diſtention of the Ligaments of the Womb, and then they are fixed in the Back,
Reins and Groins, the places where theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments are inſerted, and
ſometimes they reach to the VVomb it ſelf eſpecially when it has
ſuffered much contuſion in Labour.</p>
                     <p>To prevent theſe Pains ariſing from Wind, let the Woman
take a mixture of <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds,</hi> with <hi>Syrup of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Hair. Oyl of Wallnuts</hi> is better if the Taſt be not too Nauſcous
Theſe Medicines by their Unctuoſity, make way for the Contents of the Guts
to ſlip more eaſily through <pb n="241" facs="tcp:42110:135"/>them. If the Woman have
an averſion to any thing of this Nature, give her ſome very hot Broth, or
half a Glaſs of <hi>Hippocras,</hi> provided there be no danger of a Fever.
She muſt keep her Belly warm, muſt not drink her Ptiſan cold, and muſt
lay warm Cloths on her Belly, if her pains be very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to her,
anointing it with <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds,</hi> or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a <hi>Pancake
of Eggs</hi> fryed with <hi>Oyl of Wallnuts,</hi> taking care not to Swath it
too ſtrait. The next morning give her Clyſters made of a Decoction of the
Emollient Herbs, with a little <hi>Linſeed</hi> boyled in it, adding
<hi>Honey of Roſes</hi> and <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds</hi> of each three
Ounces, or a little <hi>freſh Butter,</hi> repeating theſe Clyſters as
oft as occaſion requires. Some Women as ſoon as they are delivered, drink
the Broth of an old Partridge boyl'd with Leeks, others take a Draught of Milk
boiled, to which they put five or ſix <hi>Walnuts</hi> pounded with a little
<hi>Sugar,</hi> and ſo ſtrain all hot through a Linen Cloth, but theſe
Remedies are inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, if the pains ariſe from any extraneous Bodies
retained in the Womb; for theſe muſt neceſſarily be expelled, and when
that is effected, the Pains will ceaſe of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, except the Blood
happen to leave any Clods, and if ſo, theſe will not fail to produce as
ſharp Pains as thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Labour.</p>
                     <p>If the Cleanſings which were copious before, happen to be
ſtopt on a fudden, vehement and ſharp pains will follow, and care muſt be
taken to procure an Evacuation of them by Clyſters, Hot and Aperitive
Fomentations applied to the Privities, and Bleeding in the Foot.</p>
                     <p>As for the Pains in the Back and Groins, which proceed from
the great extenſion of the Ligaments, they are to be removed by Reſt, and a
Regular way of Living.</p>

                     <p>When the Cleanſings are ſuppreſt, the Humours corrupt
by their long ſtay in the VVomb, or cauſe ſome Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the
Cleanſings happen to be ſuppreſt in the firſt Day, there enſues an
acute Fever, a vehement Pain in the Head, Pains in the Breaſt, Reins and
Back, a Suffocation and an Inflammation, which extends all over the lower
Belly, and this becomes diſtended. Beſides this, the Woman finds a great
difficulty of Breathing, ſtoppage at Stomach, palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart,
<hi>Syncopes,</hi> Convulſions and <hi>Delirium,</hi> and theſe Symptoms
frequently prove Mortal to her. If the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion continues, there is
great danger of an Abſceſs in the VVomb, or perhaps of a <hi>Cancer</hi> or
Apoſthumes in the lower Belly, Sciatica's, Lameneſs, or Inflammations, and
Abſceſſes of the Breaſts, according as the Humours take there
cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and theſe Suppreſſions are more dangerous by much, than

                     <p>A Looſeneſs ſometimes is the cauſe of the

Veſſels, and coagulates the Blood in the Womb, Cold Drink, and
Reſtringent Meats have the ſame effect, and very much ſtirring,
diffuſes the Humours through the whole Body, and hinders their diſcharge by

                     <p>Schirrhous Swellings frequently proceed from the
applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cold and Reſtringent Medicines to the VVomans Belly, or
injecting ſomething of that kind into the Womb.</p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:42110:137"/>
                     <p>If the internal Orifice only is Schirrhous, the VVomb is not
larger than the common ſize; but if the whole Body of it be affected, it is
exceedingly tumefied, and this often happens upon an Inflammation after Labour,
or upon ſome diſorder or ſuppreſſion of the Courſes. For the more
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowing there is a Schirroſity in the Womb, lay your Hand on the
Womans Belly, or introduce your Finger into the Womb, and you will find it big
with an extraordinary hardneſs. The inner Orifice is larger, harder,
ſhorter, and more unequal, than it ought if there be no Inflammation, or the
<hi>Schirrus</hi> be not diſpoſed to Cancerate, it is indolent, but if it
be inclined to either of theſe, the Pain is very great.</p>
                     <p>If the Womb be Schirrous, the Woman finds a great
Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude, a Weight at the bottom of her Belly, feels Pains in her Reins,
Groins and Hips, and has a frequent Motion to make Water, and theſe Pains
increaſe when ſhe makes an effort to void her Excrements, becauſe the
Womb com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the <hi>Rectum</hi> and the Bladder by its Weight. The
Courſes are entirely ſuppreſt, or in very ſmall quantity, or
irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, which is occaſioned by the Obſtruction of the Part.</p>
                     <p>The beſt way to begin the Cure, is by bleeding in the Arm,
and gentle Purging, for violent Purging in this caſe is hurtful, and
exaſperates the Diſeaſe, Emollient Oyls, Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Cataplaſins
applied to the Belly, and emollient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections into the Womb are
ſerviceable, after which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may uſe the Whole or Half-bath. After
ſhe has for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days been treated in this manner, let her bleed in the
Foot, refrain from Copulation, and obſerve a cooling Diet to allay the Heat
of the Blood. Thin Milk, eſpecially that of Aſſes is good in this
Diſtemper, but the drinking the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters, is yet better.</p>

                     <p>This is commonly the conſequence of a Schirroſity,
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation or Apoſthume, after Labour. Ill conditioned Whites, and
virulent Gonorrhoeas of long ſtanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce very much to this, by the
eroſion of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>It ſometimes happens to Women upon a ceſſation of
their Courſes, becauſe the Veſſels being ſtopt by degrees, the blood
brought to the Womb, ſtagnates, corrupts and ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſubſtance of

                     <p>When a Woman has a <hi>Cancer</hi> in the Womb, ſhe feels
a pricking pain, and a heavineſs which is cauſed by the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of
the Humours, and the bearing down of the Womb. This Pain extends to the Reins
and Groins, and the Patient feels a great Weight at the bottom of her Belly,
and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Laſſitude of the whole Body; ſhe has a difficulty of
Urine, and a Serous, Faetid, Virulent, Blackiſh Gleet comes from the Womb.
Sometimes the Blood comes away whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fluid, and ſometimes it is concreted.
When the Ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the inner Orifice of the Womb, it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Finger, or may be ſeen by the help of the <hi>Speculum Matricis;</hi>
but if it be in the bottom, there is no way to know it but by the condition of
the Matter which comes from it, and by the Symptoms above mentioned. Theſe
Ulcers are very unequal, Sordid and Stinking, and the Corruption is ſometimes
ſo great, as to breed Worms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cancers</hi> of the Womb are incurable, and only admit
of Palliating Remedies, which abate the violence of the Pains. The Patient
muſt not take any thing ſharp, either inwardly or outwardly, for fear of
increaſing the Diſeaſe and Pain, and haſtning her End.</p>
                     <p>Women who have a <hi>Schirrhus</hi> or Apoſtem in their
Wombs, or who are ſubject to Flooding, or have a Ceſſation of their
Courſes, eſpecially when they are advanced in years, are moſt of all
ſubject to <hi>Cancers.</hi> Such Perſons as are threatned with this
Diſeaſe, upon the account of the ceaſing of their Courſes, have no
better Expedient than to bleed in the Arm at convenient times, to ſupply the
defect of that Evacuation, and by this means prevent too great a Redundancy of
Blood and Humours in the Womb; and this they ought to do for ſeveral years
together, till thoſe Veſſels which convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Blood are very much
diminiſhed. If ſuch a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has been very ſubject to frequent
Haemorrhages, let her refrain from Copulation, becauſe this Action brings
Blood into the part; Let her obſerve a cool and moiſt Diet, and ſhun all
Aperitive, Diuretick or Violent purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; Let her drink new Milk from
the Cow to ſweeten the Blood, and frequently drink Broths made of Pullets,
whoſe Bellies were firſt ſtuffed with the cold Seeds. The Cow whoſe
Milk ſhe drinks muſt be ſound and not overheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fed with good
Paſture, and one who has not lately Calved; for all Errours of this kind are
dangerous.</p>

that it breaks through the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and cauſes Ruptures ſo

happen above and below the Navel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Muſculi Recti,</hi> in the
Navel it ſelf, and in the Groins, which are the weakeſt parts of the Belly.
They commonly proceed from great Straining of a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Labour, or vehement
Vomitings, or violent and frequent Sneezing, or ſome accidental blow on the
Belly. This Diſeaſe cauſes want of Digeſtion, Vomiting and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere

                     <p>If a Woman with Child has received a Blow on her Breaſts,
or compreſſed them by lying on them, or has left too great a quantity of
Milk in them, without drawing them, an Inflammation will infallibly enſue,
which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is the cauſe of Apoſtems or Schirroſities, which
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into <hi>Cancers.</hi> The Breaſts being very ſenſible when
they are inflamed, ſoon produce a continual Fever with
<hi>Deliriums.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The beſt way to prevent an Inflammation of the Breaſts,
is to procure a good Evacuation of the Cleanſings, and if they are
ſuppreſt to provoke them, that ſo all the Humours which flowed too
plentifully to the Breaſts, may take their courſe downwards. For this
purpoſe bleed her firſt in the Arm, and then in the Foot. In the mean time
Embrocate the Breaſts well with a Mixture of <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds,</hi>
and after that apply <hi>Galen's, cooling Emplaſter,</hi> with a third part
of <hi>Populeum,</hi> or a Cataplaſm made of the <hi>Setlings found in a
Cutlers Grindſtone Trough,</hi> and Oyl of Roſes with a little Vinegar, or
if the Pain be violent, make a Cataplaſm with the <hi>Crumb of White Bread,
Milk, Oyl of ſweet Almonds,</hi> and the <hi>Yelks of Eggs,</hi> and apply it
to the Breaſts, and over that lay Compreſſes dipt in <hi>Oxycrate</hi> or
<hi>Plantane Water.</hi> But great caution is to be uſed in Aſtringent
Remedies, leaſt if they be too ſtrong, they occaſion a <hi>Schirrus,</hi>
which in time may become Cancerous.</p>
                     <p>After the Height of the Inflammation is over, let
Diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients be uſed to diſſipate the Milk, which flows in too great
abundance to the Breaſts, but the beſt way in this caſe, is to draw them
by Sucking; for if any great quantity be left in the Breaſts, it will
neceſſarily Suppurate. However it is neceſſary to uſe
diſcuſſing Applications firſt, becauſe Sucking brings Milk into the
Breaſts. But if the Milk runs off it ſelf leave it, for this is enough to
empty them. Milk may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by applying a Cataplaſm of <hi>pure
Honey</hi> to the part, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ubbing them with a red Cabbage Leaf, having firſt deadned it by
the Fire, and taking care not to ſtraiten the Breaſt. The following
Diſcutient is very good. Take a good <hi>Red Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage</hi> 
                        <pb n="249" facs="tcp:42110:139"/>and boil it in <hi>River Water</hi> till it be ſoft,

and apply this Cataplaſm to the Breaſts.</p>
                     <p>Let the VVoman in the mean time uſe a cool Diet, not very
Nouriſhing, to prevent breeding too much Chile. Let her keep her Body open,
that ſo the Humours may diſcharge themſelves downwards, while the
Inflammation remains; let her lie in Bed on her Back, becauſe when ſhe is
up, the Weight of her Breaſts increaſes the Pain. On the fourteenth or
fifteenth day after her delivery, when the Cleanſings are pretty well come
away, and ſhe is free from a Fever, ſhe may be purged as often as ſeems
convenient. If notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the uſe of theſe Remedies the Pain do's

Breaſts.</head>
                     <p>About the fourteenth or fifteenth day after Labour, the Milk
often is apt to Curdle, and then the Breaſts become hard, unequal, and
rugged, without any Redneſs, and all the Glands filled with curdled Milk, may
eaſily be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The VVoman finds a great Pain; and cannot Milk them
as before, ſhe finds a Shivering in her Back, which ſeems to be like Ice.
This is followed by a Fever of four and twenty Hours continuance, and
ſometimes leſs, if the clodding of the Milk do not turn to an Inflammation
of the Breaſt, which will undoubtedly happen, if it be not emptied or
diſſipated.</p>
                     <p>This clodding of the Milk, for the moſt part proceeds from
the Breaſts not being well drawn, either becauſe ſhe has too much Milk,
or the Infant is too weak, or ſhe has no deſire to be a Nurſe; for the
Milk in theſe caſes remaining in the Breaſt, ſours and clods. This
Accident may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen from taking Cold, or keeping the Breaſts not
well cover'd.</p>
                     <p>The moſt certain Remedy in this Caſe, is to draw the
Breaſts ſpeedily, till they are well evacuated, but becauſe the VVoman is
not ſoft Milcht, and the Child cannot draw them ſtrongly enough, let
another Woman draw them till the Milk comes freely, and then ſhe may give the
Child Suck; and to the end that ſhe may not afterwards breed more Milk than
the Child can draw, let her uſe a Diet that yields but little Nouriſhment,
and keep her Body o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. <pb n="250" facs="tcp:42110:140"/>But when it happens the VVoman
neither can nor will be a Nurſe, then her Breaſts muſt not be drawn, for
fear of attracting more Humours, for the Diſeaſe will ever recur, if they
be not emptied; wherefore it is neceſſary to prevent the coming of any more
Milk into them, and to reſolve and diſſipate that which is there. For
this purpoſe the Woman muſt be bled in the Arm, have ſtrong Clyſters
given her. Bleeding in the Foot and Purging, are very ſerviceable in this
Caſe, and to reſolve and diſſipate the curdled Milk, apply ſome
Cataplaſm above recommended, as that of pure <hi>Honey,</hi> or the <hi>four
Meals</hi> boiled in a Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sage, Mint, Smallage</hi> and
<hi>Fennel,</hi> mixing with it <hi>Oyl of Chamomil,</hi> with which Oyl the
Breaſts may be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. Cloths laid over pots of <hi>Salt Butter</hi>
are very good, after having uſed all things proper to reſolve the concreted
Milk.</p>

Apoſtemate.</p>
                     <p>To ſuppurate the Apoſtem, apply on the Breaſts an
Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient and Ripening Cataplaſm made of <hi>Mallows, Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi>
with their Roots, <hi>Lily Roots</hi> and <hi>Linſeed</hi> bruiſed, and
boiled to a Pap, that it may be pulped through a Sieve, and ſo no hardneſs
may be left to hurt the Breaſts, which at that time are in great Pain, after
mix a good quantity of <hi>Hogs-greaſe</hi> or <hi>Baſilicon</hi> with it,
or lay a little Cloth thick ſpread with the ſame <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> upon
the place where it is likely to break, and the Poultis all over it, renewing it
twelve Hours after, or at fartheſt next day, continuing this Remedy till the
Apoſtem be ripe. Or you may make uſe of the <hi>Emplaſtrum Divinum,</hi>
malaxed with <hi>Oyl of Lilies;</hi> This is preferable to all others of the
like Nature, for this purpoſe. As ſoon as the Apoſtem is Ripe, it muſt
be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it open not of it ſelf. The time when it is ſit, may be
known by the ceaſing of the beating the Woman felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in her Breaſts,
and that the Pain and Fever is very much abated, and then beſides the middle
of the Apoſtem is raiſed to a Point, and very ſoft, and the contained
Matter may by the Finger be perceived to fluctuate. The Apertion muſt be made
with a Lancet, or with a grain or two of ſome <pb n="251" facs="tcp:42110:140"/>Cauſtick, making it large enough to evacuate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted Matter.
It is beſt to uſe the Lancet, becauſe there is no loſs of Subſtance,
and the Scar is not ſo Disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The Orifice muſt be made in the moſt

and putrified clodded Milk is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, deterge the Apoſtem after the
ordinary manner, obſerving not to make the Tents too long, or too hard, but
of very ſoft Doſſils of Lint, without thruſting them too far in, and
faſten a Thread to the firſt to draw it out, if there be occaſion,
becauſe theſe Apoſtems are moſt commonly deep. If there be great Pain,
dip the Pledgits in <hi>Oyl of Eggs,</hi> or <hi>Baſilicon</hi> mixt with
ſome Digeſtive, if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any thing yet to Suppurate; after this

                     <p>If there be ſeveral Apoſtems in different places of the
Breaſt, in this caſe there is no need of laying open every one of theſe
ſmall Holes, but it ſuffices to make one or two Apertures in ſome
depending part large enough, becauſe the Breaſts are Spungy, and theſe
Apoſtems communicate with each other. But the moſt prompt Remedy, is to
drive the Milk quite back; and for this purpoſe give the VVoman Clyſters,
and purge her frequently, confining her to a Diet which is not very
Nouriſhing.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not always ſtay till the Cataplaſms break the

                     <p>Some VVomen in Hyſterick Fits have a high Pulſe, others
a very low one, as it were ſunk in, others have ſcarce any at all; ſome
became pale and motionleſs, others have a good colour in their Cheeks, and
have ſeveral Convulſions, ſome have not the leaſt appearance of Breath,
and others Breath with great Difficulty, and great Heavings of the Breaſt;
ſome are inſenſible, without remembring any thing they have done, or
ſaid; others never loſe their Reaſon or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome are Gay and
Merry, Langhing and Singing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are Sad and Dejected. Some are attacked
with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Fits, others very ſeldom. The Fits ſometimes laſt for
ſeveral Hours or Days, and ſometimes are ſuddenly over. The moſt
ordinary Signs of the Hyſterick Paſſion, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing,
which cauſes a Suffocation with a great conſtriction of the Throat, as if
the Patient had a Morſel which ſhe could not ſwallow, and the Throat were
griped with a Mans Hand. There is a great VVeakneſs and Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the
Heart, <hi>Nauſea's,</hi> and ſometimes a Flux of VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Seroſities
from the Mouth; frequent yawning, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is a Fore-runner of the Fit. The
VVoman feels a Pulſation of the Arteries in the bottom of her Belly, a
leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contraction of the VVomb, a Ruſling of wind in the 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42110:142"/>Stomach and Guts which diſtends them, and bears up the
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphragm, ſometimes ſhe is delirious in the Fit, and has Convulſive
Motions preceded by a Pain, VVeight, and Dizzineſs of the Head, Dazling of
the Eyes, Drowſineſs and Forgetfulneſs. Sometimes after theſe
Convulſive Motions, ſhe is thrown into a Mortal Apoplexy, or a Palſie of
one ſide, which continues for ſeveral years.</p>
                     <p>To prevent this Diſtemper, if there be a Suppreſſion
of the Cleanſings, bring them down by relaxing all the parts round the VVomb,
and the Thighs by a half-Bath, by bleeding in the Foot and purging. If it be a
Big-bellied VVoman who labours under this Diſtemper, let her only bleed, and
keep her Body open with Clyſters. The uſe of the Mineral VVaters is
admirable, to prevent the Hyſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Paſſion, in caſe the Patient be
not with Child. If the Suffocation proceed from any extraneous Body in the
VVomb, extract it, or procure its expulſion by Medicines. Let the Patient
avoid all ſweet ſcented things, all Sweet-Meats, or any thing prepared with
Sugar, all Melancholy and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſions, and keep her Body open.
If ſhe be a Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed VVoman, let her often embrace the privileges of that
State if not, let her keep a cooling Diet, uſing Emulſions and Bathing.</p>
                     <p>In the Fit which is ordinarily attended with difficulty of
Breathing Suffocation, VVeakneſs, Palpitations of the Heart, it is uſual to
preſent to the Patient things which have a very ill Scent, as <hi>Partridge
Feathers,</hi> or Soals of Shooes burnt. Some fling a Dram of lighted
<hi>Camphire</hi> into a pot of VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, leaving it till it be extinguiſhed,
and give this VVater to the Patient to drink, or give two or three drops of Oyl
of <hi>Amber</hi> in a Spoonful of Broath, or <hi>Orange-flower Water.</hi> But
the beſt way is to unlace the Patients Cloths, and give her a Spoonful or two
of <hi>Cinnamon-Water</hi> or <hi>Aqua-vitae;</hi> this is a good Cordial, and
promptly diſſipates the VVindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Stomach, which is the cauſe
of theſe Suffocations. A Spoonful or two of VVine alone is very good.
Smelling to <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> is better than Vinegar. The
ſcent of <hi>burnt Paper,</hi> or a <hi>Musket Match</hi> is very good. If
ſhe be with Child, ſhe may not ſmell too ſtinking Scents, for fear
ſhe Miſcarry. If ſhe be not with Child, let her take Sneezing Powders,
with Powder of <hi>Betony,</hi> or <hi>Tobacco</hi> without Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume. You may
put a grain or two of Salt into the Patients Mouth, to bring away the VVater
and Seroſities which ſlow thither in great abundance.</p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:42110:142"/>
                     <p>If any large Evacuations precede the Fit as a great
Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Flooding, or an immoderate Flux of the VVhites, or a great
abundance of the Cleanſings, and the VVomans Pulſe be low and languid, her
Face pale, and her Body cold, you muſt forbear bleeding; on the contrary, it
ſhe have a Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Colour in her Face, her Pulſe be high, and there be a
Suppreſſion of the Courſes or Cleanſings before, and ſhe have
Convulſive Motions, I think bleeding is very proper, firſt in the Arm, and
after in the Foot.</p>

                     <p>It is very difficult to diſtinguiſh VVhites in VVomen,
from virulent <hi>Gonorrhoea's.</hi> In the VVhites the Matter is whiter, more
ſerous, eſpecially if it be copious, and leſs foetid than in
<hi>Gonorrhoea's.</hi> On the contrary, in Venereal caſes it is more
ſtinking, thick, blackiſh, yellowiſh, greeniſh, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is of
a rediſh Colour, by the mixture of a bloody Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. VVhen a VVoman has
the VVhites, the Courſes become irregular; ſometimes inſtead of her
Courſes, ſhe has a Flux of Blood which becomes ſerous, and appears like
the VVater in which Fleſh has been waſhed; when it is a little abated,
after ſome time ſome clods of black corrupted blood come away among the
putrid Matter. A VVoman who has the VVhites, can lie with her Husband without
pain, but ſhe who has an Ulcer cannot. The Matter which comes away in the
VVhites, moſt commonly is VVhite, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, not unlike VVhey, without any ill
Scent, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is yellow, ſtinks, and by its Acrimony cauſes a
great Smarting of the Parts. It is very difficult to diſtinguiſh the
VVhites from <hi>Gonorrhaea's.</hi> VVomen with Child are more ſubject to
this Diſtemper, which is occaſioned by the Suppreſſion of their
Courſes. Few VVomen are wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from this inconvenience, but at ſome
time or other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour under it; but ſome are much more ſubject to it than
others. Women who have not their Courſes regularly, thoſe who are
Phlegmatick, have a ſoft Skin, are pale coloured, or lead a Melancholy
Sedentary Life, are moſt of all ſubject to the Whites; but young Girls who
are not of an Age to have their Courſes, never have them. The Whites weaken
the Woman, humect and relax the Womb to that degree it cannot contract and
cloſe it ſelf, and by conſequence cauſe Barrenneſs. The Womans
Countenance becomes pale, her Legs ſwell, ſhe loſes her Appetite, has
Pains in her Back, <pb n="256" facs="tcp:42110:143"/>Weakneſs, Palpitation of Heart, and
Hyſterick Fits. If the Whites continue long the Woman is emaciated, and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Hectical; Nay, ſometimes ſuch a Relaxation of the Womb enſues,
that it becomes Cancerous if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>For the Cure of this Diſtemper, Bleed and Purge the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient well, and preſcribe a good Diet to her; let her go to the Baths, and
after drink the Chalybeate Waters, or others of the like Nature. Phlegmatick
Women whoſe Fleſh is tender and ſoft, ought to drink the hot VVaters, as
thoſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Vichy</hi> in <hi>France</hi> [or the Bath
in <hi>England</hi>] or a Sudorifick Decoction made of the Roots of
<hi>China</hi> and <hi>Salſa-parilla,</hi> taking for a fortnight before, a

<hi>Sal Polycreſtum;</hi> and during this time, let her obſerve a good
Diet, refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Copulation, and avoiding all Melancholy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of Mind. The moſt proper time to begin the uſe of Medicines, is immediately
after the Courſes are over. After theſe Medicines, the Patient may uſe
Aſtringent Injections made of equal parts of <hi>Plantane</hi> and <hi>Myrrh
Water,</hi> but ſhe muſt forbear when the time of the Courſes is near,
for fear they cauſe a Suppreſſion; for my part, I would not adviſe any
VVoman to uſe Styptick Applications, becauſe this part is the common Sink,
where all the Filth of the Body is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
                     <p>When the VVhites are very Acrimonious, and cauſe a

Courſes,) to allay the Heat and Pain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a good Diet, and between
whiles, purging her till the Cure be compleated.</p>
                     <p>Tho' the Patient may ſeem to be cured, and the Whites
ceaſe, or at leaſt are very much abated, the VVoman muſt
notwithſtanding frequently take Medicines, and all her Life obſerve a good

                     <p>It is not uſual to give a Child Suck, till ten or twelve
Hours after its Birth, and then the Nurſe muſt Milk a little 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42110:143"/>into its Mouth and on its Lips to give it a Reliſh, and
when the Child has taken the Breaſt ſhe muſt ſqueeze it till it be
accuſtomed to Suck of its own accord.</p>
                     <p>If a Nurſe have plenty of Milk, give the Child no other
Food for the firſt two Months; but for the firſt two or three Days, give it
but a little at a time, for fear of overcharging its Stomach, and after
encreaſe the quantlty. When the Child is grown a little bigger, you may give
it either in the Day or Night, as much as it deſires, a little and often, for
if it take too much at a time, it vomits it up, the Stomach being too weak to
digeſt it. But if you can govern the Child, it would be better to give it the
Breaſt but once every two Hours, and never in the Night-time, unleſs when
it wants Sleep.</p>
                     <p>After the Child has been fed the firſt two or three Months
with Breaſt-Milk only, you may give him a Pap made of Flour and Milk, though
but little at firſt, and not too thick neither leſt his Stomach be
overcharged. That this may be eaſier of Digeſtion, put the Meal in an
Earthen Pan into an Oven, as ſoon as the Bread is drawn, ſtirring it often
to dry it equally. Pap made thus, is much better than the common way; for being
made with raw Flour, it is very difficult to boil it well, without conſuming
the beſt part of the Milk, leaving the thickeſt part behind, which by its
long boiling loſes its goodneſs. When the Child has taken Pap thus made,
which muſt be but once a day, (eſpecially in the Morning) or twice at
moſt, the Nurſe may give it Suck to waſh it down into the Stomach, and
dilute it there.</p>
                     <p>If Pap be given to a Child newly Born, as ſome Women
indiſcreetly do, it cauſes Obſtructions, Difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Gripes, Swelling of the Belly, and Convulſions, of all which Death is the
Reſult, and therefore it is beſt to forbear the three or four firſt
Months, provided the Nurſe do not want, Milk.</p>
                     <p>VVhen the Child has ſucked its Fill, let the Nurſe lay
it to Sleep, not in the ſame Bed ſhe lies in her ſelf, for fear of
over-laying it, but in a Cradle cloſe by her Bed-ſide, and let her put a
Mantle over the Head of the Cradle, to prevent Duſt falling on its Face, and
the Day-light, Sun-ſhine, Candle or Fire in the Chamber from offending it;
let her lay it to ſleep on its Back with its Head a little raiſed upon a
Pillow, and to make it Sleep the ſooner, let her rock gently with an equal
Motion, without too great ſhaking; but that ſhe <pb n="258" facs="tcp:42110:144"/>would
have him go to ſleep, it is beſt not to uſe him to it at firſt. He may
ſleep at any time in the Day or Night, and ordinarily the better he is the
more he ſleeps; however if he exceeds in this reſpect, let his Nurſe
carry him in her Arms to the Light, ſing ſome little Song to him, ſhew
him ſome glittering thing, or dance him in her Arms.</p>
                     <p>VVhen he is in the Cradle, let it be ſo turned that the
Light may be directly in his Face, that he may not be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look aſide;
for doing ſo often, his Sight will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and he become Squint-eyed.
But the beſt way is to let him ſee no Light at all.</p>
                     <p>The Nurſe muſt open and change the Child, at leaſt
twice or thrice a Day, and ſometimes in the Night too, if it be neceſſary
to cleanſe him from his Excrements, and ſhift the Blankets, which muſt be
put into a Bucking-Tub, and not ſlightly waſhed, as moſt hired Nurſes
do; becauſe there comes a certain Salt from the Excrements, which
inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf into them, and cauſes a great itching, ſmarting,
and excoriation of the Childs Body.</p>
                     <p>The Child muſt always be opened before the Fire, and his
Blankets and Clouts well warmed and dryed, before he be put into them, leaſt
their cold and dampneſs, cauſe a Cholick and Gripes. The Nurſe muſt put
Rags behind his Ears, and under his Arm-pits, to dry up the Moiſture. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the firſt four or five Days, ſhe muſt be careful not to make the
remaining part of the Navil-ſtring fall off too ſoon, before the
Veſſels be cloſed, and every time ſhe opens the Child, ſhe muſt
ſee whether the Navel for want of being ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faſt do not bleed; and after
the end is fallen off, let her ſtill for ſome time Swathe the Navel,
continuing to keep a Compreſs on it till it be well cicatrized, and
ſomething ſunk in. Beſides this, let her put upon the Mold of the Head
under the Biggin, another Compreſs to keep the Brain warm, and prevent the
Childs taking cold. Let her alſo be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to ſuffer the Child
to cry too much, eſpecially at firſt, leaſt the Navel be protruded
outwards, and cauſe an <hi>Exom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalos,</hi> or a Rupture in the Groin. The
beſt way to quiet him is to give him the Breaſt, and to lay him clean and
dry and preſent ſomething to amuſe and pleaſe him.</p>
                     <p>Some fooliſh Nurſes uſe to ſuck the Childs Breaſt,
to draw out the Seroſities, and form a Nipple in Girls, but this is a
ridiculous Practice; it ſuffices in this caſe to apply Rags dipt in <hi>Oyl

                     <p>The beſt way to prevent theſe ſort of Tumours, is to

Mould of their Head, and the Sutures open. This ariſes from the diſtance
and ſeparation of the Bones from one another, which are not ſteddy, but may
be moved to and fro, and yield on every ſide. VVhen this happens, you muſt
not think to bring the Bones together by binding the Head ſtrait, for this

                     <p>Many Children are ſo griped, that they cannot forbear
crying out Night nor Day. This is the firſt Diſtemper which happens to
them, and they often die of it.</p>
                     <p>The principal cauſe of theſe Gripes, is the
<hi>Meconium</hi> which is contained in their Guts, which by its long ſtay

Breaſt-Milk ſoon after Labour, before it be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, or perhaps becauſe
the Child has taken Cold. Very often theſe Gripes proceed from giving him Pap
too ſoon, or not well boiled; becauſe this is Groſs, Viſcous, and apt
to engender VVind in the Stomach. Worms ſometimes by their ſtirring and
biting, do very much torment Children. In the laſt place, the Mid-wife may

                     <p>The Breeding of Teeth is the cauſe of a great many
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and often proves fatal to Children. In the time of their cutting,
they are troubled with Inflammations of the Gams, Feavers, Convulſions,
Looſneſſes, eſpecially when the Dog or Eye-teeth cur, and the Child is
large, full of Humours and Coſtive.</p>
                     <p>VVhen the Teeth cut, the Gums and Cheeks ſwell, there is a
great Heat and Itching, which often makes Children put their Fingers into their
Mouth to rub them, from whence ſome moiſture Diſtils down into the Mouth,
becauſe of the Pain they feel there; the Nurſe in giving them ſuck, finds
the Mouth hotter; they are very much changed and cry every Moment, and cannot
ſleep, or but very little; and ſmall points of the Teeth may be ſeen and
ſelt through the Gums, which appear thin and pale on the top, and Red and
Inflamed on the ſides; and if it happens to be a long time, the Pain is ſo
exceſſive, that it ſometimes kills the Child.</p>
                     <p>To prevent theſe Accidents, the Nurſe muſt keep a good
Diet, and uſe all things that may allay the Heat of her Milk, for fear of
putting the Child in a Feaver, who already is very much in Pain; and let his
Body he kept open with Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters if he be bound.</p>
                     <p>To help the cutting of the Teeth, let the Nurſe from time
to time paſs her Finger over the Childs Gums, gently rubbing them; and give
him a ſtick of Liquorice to champ, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle end of a ſmall new
VVax-candle, which is very good to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Gum; or a Silver Coral with
ſmall Bells to divert him from thinking on the Pain he feels. Some VVomen
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Coral, put a VVolfs Tooth in. If the Gums are hard and thick,
theſe things do no good; ſome Nurſes make an Inciſion with their Nail;
but 'tis better done with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, becauſe that is not ſo painful, and
makes no Contuſion.</p>

                     <head>Of the Small-Pox and Meazles in Children.</head>
                     <p>The Small Pox is a Diſeaſe in which abundance of ſmall
Puſtles do break out all over the Body, which grow white, and after ripen.
The Symptoms of the Small Pox and Meazles are ſo very like, that it is
difficult to diſtinguiſh them on the firſt, ſecond or third Day.</p>
                     <p>The Signs which precede the Eruption of the Pox are a
Feaver, <hi>Stupor,</hi> a great Beating and Pain of the Head, Laſſitude, a
Pain in the Back, Sickneſs, Vomiting, Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Breathing, Yawning,
Sneezing, Itching of the <pb n="269" facs="tcp:42110:150"/>Noſe, Inflammation of the
Eyes, a general wearineſs of the whole Body, and a Urine very turbid. As for
the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the third or fourth Day, a great many ſmall Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules
ariſe, which encreaſe in bigneſs and number till the eighth or ninth Day;
at which time they grow white, and gradually ripen; and the Face and Head
Swell, the Eyes are cloſed by the diſtention of the Eye-lids, the Noſe is
ſtopt, the Voice grows Hoarſe, there is a dry Cough, a Pain in the Throat,
and a great Difficulty of Breathing; If there be abundance of Puſtules, the
whole Body is Swoln.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſort of Small Pox void of Malignity, this at
firſt is attended with a Feaver, which ceaſes immediately after the
Eruption, the Puſtules riſe to a point, ſuppurate kindly, and are ſoon
well. The Matter is white, uniform, and well digeſted: When the Diſtemper
is Malignant, the Puſtles are brown, flat, livid, or ill coloured, have
little black ſpots in their middle, break out more ſlowly than when they
are kind, have no Digeſtion at all, or at leaſt a very bad one, are filled
with a Sanious Matter, attended with a Malignant Feaver, <hi>Delirium,</hi>
Difficulty of Breathing, <hi>Syncope,</hi> and Dyſenteries; ſometimes they
leave behind them Malignant Ulcers, Carioſity of the Bones, loſs of Sight,
Deformity of the Face, or Lameneſs of ſome Limb.</p>
                     <p>If the Feaver be not very high, and abate in proportion to
the Eruption of the Puſtles, if they be not very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and grow white
and ripen quickly, the Diſtemper is not very dangerous, but if the contrary
happen, it is a ſign of Death. The Small Pox in Children, is not ſo
dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as in grown Perſons, becauſe their Skin is more ſoft and
Porous, ſo that they break out more kindly than in thoſe who have the Skin
more compact, and the Pores not ſo open.</p>
                     <p>The Meazles are never ſo dangerous as the Small Pox,
becauſe the Peccant Matter Tranſpires more eaſily and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Theſe
are moſt commonly over in three or four Days, after which the Pox ſometimes
appears, which occaſions the one Diſtemper to be miſtaken for the
other.</p>
                     <p>For the more ſucceſsful curing this Diſtemper,
preſcribe the Child a good Diet, let him forbear all ſolid Meats, and feed
only on Liquids; ſuch as Veal or Chicken Broth, or a little Gelly. Let him
drink a Priſan of <hi>French Barley,</hi> Roots of <hi>Dogs Graſs,
Liquorice,</hi> and <hi>Raiſins of the Sun.</hi> Never give Pap to a Sucking
Child, till it be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42110:151"/>and let the
Nurſe keep a cooling Diet. Do not ſuffer her to carry her Child into the
open Air, but let her keep it cloſe in the Chamber, neither too hot nor too
cold; for too hot an Air diſſipates the Spirits, and too cold an one
ſtops the Pores, hinders Tranſpiration, and checks the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The
Childs Sleep muſt be moderate, and his Belly kept open. If the Small Pox be
attended with a High Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the beginning, together with a Difficulty of
Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other like Symptoms bleeding is neceſſary. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the
beginning of the ſmall Pox is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for fear of turning the
courſe of Humours which tend toward the Skin, but after it is proper to
evacuate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining impurities.</p>
                     <p>From time to time give the Child all ſort of Cordial and
Strengthning Things, ſuch are a pure Air, good wholſom Food, Juyce <hi>of
Oranges,</hi> Syrup <hi>of Limons,</hi> and <hi>Pomgranats</hi> in the
Ptiſan, or a little Wine allay'd with Water, but if it be a ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Child,
Milk muſt ſerve in ſtead of all other Cordials.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the Puſtles begin to appear, anoint them with
Oyl of <hi>ſweet Almonds,</hi> rubbing them with a Feather dipt in it. Some
uſe <hi>Cream, freſh Butter,</hi> or <hi>Stale Lard</hi> melted and
waſhed in <hi>Roſe-water,</hi> and beaten up in a Marble Mortar, and with
this they greaſe them till they are perfectly cured. When the Puſtles are
ripe, which may be known by their Whiteneſs and Itching, which uſually is
about the Ninth Day, the biggeſt of them may then be pierced (by a Gold or
Silver Needle, or by cutting the cops with a pair of Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors) to
diſcharge the Matter, leaſt by its too long ſtay, it ulcerate and corrode
the Part too deeply. Afterwards to dry them up, anoint the Face with a Liniment
made of freſh <hi>Cream,</hi> mixed with <hi>white Chalk,</hi> continuing
this Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy till the Scabs be quite fallen off, uſing it Night and Morning,
or make uſe of <hi>Oyntment of Roſes,</hi> with a little powder'd
<hi>Ceruſs</hi> mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>To prevent the Small Pox from cauſing too great a
Defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Eyes, apply cooling Remedies, as <hi>Roſe</hi> and
<hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Water</hi> from the beginning, Breaſt Milk is very good to bath
the Eyes with; Let the Nurſe from time to time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtop the Childs Noſe,
that ſo he may breath with more eaſe. Give him ſometimes a little Syrup
of <hi>Violets</hi> to ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his Throat, or give him a little Syrup of
<hi>Limons</hi> or <hi>Pomgranats,</hi> but Milk alone is ſufficient for a
Sucking Child.</p>

                     <head>How to cure the Venereal Pox in Children.</head>
                     <p>If the Mother have the Pox when the Child is born, it will
infallibly be infected by her, and this may be eaſily diſcovered when it is
ſo, by Buſtles and Ulcers in all parts of the Body, eſpecially in the
Belly, Fundament, Head, and between the Leggs.</p>
                     <p>If the Nurſe who gives it Suck be Poxed, ſhe will
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to the Child with her Milk. In this caſe the Diſtemper
firſt appears in the Childs Mouth, and the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Milk makes
ſeveral Ulcers in it. But we muſt not preſently conclude the Nurſe has
the Pox, becauſe the Child has Puſtles in ſeveral parts of its Body, for
theſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceed from the Milk being over-heated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome other Symptoms muſt be lookt for before you can be aſſur'd of
it.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing farther neceſſary for the cure of
ſimple Puſtles, than changing the firſt Nurſe, and giving the Child to
another whoſe Milk is ſweeter, and who will take care to keep it clean. But
Children who come into the World with the Pox on them, moſt commonly die of
it, and thoſe who receive it from their Nurſes, are very difficultly cured,
their tender Age being unable to ſupport the Fatigue of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
                     <p>If the Nurſe be Poxed, take the Child from her and give it
to one who is Sound, who muſt be confined to a cooling Diet. Let the Nurſe
waſh her Nipple with Wine every time ſhe gives the Child Suck, and let her
Purge from time to time, for fear of being infected. If no Nurſe can be found
who will venture to Suckle the Child for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected her ſelf,
take one who has abundance of Milk, and let her ſqueeze her Breaſt and drop
it into the Childs Mouth, or let her Milk her Breaſt into a Porringer, and
give it a Spoonful now and then, or let her put her Milk into a Funnel, at the
end of which there is faſten'd a Rag rowl'd up, and put this into the Childs
Mouth for him to ſuck, or dip Rags in her Milk and let him ſuck them. But
the beſt way is to let him ſuck a young Goat, fed on purpoſe with good
Hay, and other convenient things.</p>
                     <p>Let the Child be Bled and Purged, and after if he have
Strength enough, anoint him with a Mercurial Oyntment, rubbing only the
Puſtles and Ulcers, in doing which and reiterating the Frictions a ſmall
Flux will be raiſed by degrees, which <pb n="272" facs="tcp:42110:152"/>muſt be
almoſt inſenſible, leaſt the Humours being ſtirred and carried in too
great abundance to the Mouth, cauſe it to Swell and Ulcerate, and hinder the
Childs Sucking. Wherefore but a ſmall quantity, of Mercury muſt be mixed
with the Oyntment, and after one Friction or two, you muſt forbear five or
ſix Days; and ſee how the Flux will riſe, and then if there be
occaſion, give a few Grains of the Mercurial <hi>Panacea</hi> in the Childs
Pap. Let the Nurſe waſh its Mouth with a Lotion of <hi>Barley Water,</hi>
with the addition of <hi>Honey of Roſes,</hi> or Syrup <hi>of Wormwood</hi>
with <hi>White-wine,</hi> to clear it from the froth which is uſually
ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about it, and that he may void the Drivel better, let him lie upon
his Side and not upon his Back, leaſt falling upon the Stomach or upon the
Lungs, it ſhould choak him. Let him be always kept warm without carrying him
into the Air, and watch diligently the effects of the Medicine.</p>
                     <p>The common Way to make this Mercurial Oynment, is thus; Take
half an Ounce of <hi>Quick-ſilder,</hi> paſs it through a Leather to clear
it from its adhering Filth, and then mix it in a Mortar with four Ounces of
<hi>Hogs. Greaſe,</hi> till it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well incorporated; then take two
Drams of this Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for each Friction, more or leſs in proportion to the
Childs Strength.</p>

                     <head>How to chuſe a good Nurſe.</head>
                     <p>The Mother is doubtleſs the beſt Nurſe that a Child
can have, if there be no reaſon to the contrary. The beſt Age for a
Nurſe, is from 25 Years to 35, becauſe about that time, a Woman is
ſtronger and more healthy than at any other. The common Opinion is, that a
Woman is moſt fit to be a Nurſe, two or three Months after her Delivery,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that time the Milk is purified, and her Body pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by her
Cleanſings, but ſhe cannot be ſo much longer, becauſe in this caſe
the Milk would not continue ſo long, as would be neceſſary to ſuckle
the Child. She muſt not have Miſcarryed, but had her Child at due time. The
Milk of a Woman who has been Delivered of a Male Child, is commonly thought to
be beſt, and it is to be preferred if it be her Second Child, becauſe ſhe
may then very well be ſuppoſed to have ſome Experience in the Ordering
and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging her Infant. <hi>Mauricean</hi> prefers Milk of a Fortnight old,
to that of three or four Months, and if it be for a Girl, he prefers a Nurſe
who has a Girl, to one who has had a Boy.</p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:42110:152"/>
                     <p>She muſt be Sound and Healthy, and born of Parents who
were ſo, and never had the, Stone, Gout, Kings-Evil, Falling-Sickneſs, or
any other Hereditary Diſtemper. She ought to have a clear Skin free from all
Scabs, Itch or Scald; ſhe ought to be ſtrong and able to watch and tend the
Child as occaſion requires. It is convenient ſhe be of a middle Stature,
neither too large nor too little, too lean or too fat; but above all, ſhe
muſt not be with Child. Let her Complexion be Sanguine, and her Fleſh plump
and firm. She muſt not have her Courſes, for that is a ſign her Blood is
too hot, or ſhe is too amorous; ſhe muſt not have the Whites, for theſe
are a ſign of a bad Habit, ſhe muſt not be red Haired, or markt with any
Spots, but her Hair muſt be black or of a Cheſnut brown. She muſt be well
ſhaped, neat in her Cloths, and handſom in her Face, having a Sprightly
Eye, and Smiling Countenance; ſhe muſt have good Eyes, Sound and White
Teeth, and ought to have a Sweet Voice, to ſing to and pleaſe the Child.
She muſt have no ill Scent come from her, as uſually red Haired Women have,
and thoſe who have black Hair and a white Skin, for their Milk is Hot, Sharp,
and of an ill Taſt and Scent; She muſt not have a ſtrong Breath, as they
who have a ſtinking Noſe, and bad Teeth, becauſe ſhe would infect the
Childs Lungs by often drawing in the corrupted Air.</p>
                     <p>Her Breaſts ought to be pretty large to contain a
ſufficient quantity of Milk; they ought to be pretty firm and plump, and not
flaggy or hanging down; for a large ſtrutting Breaſt, is the Mark of a good
Habit of Body. As for the Nipples they muſt be well ſhaped, not too big nor
hard, nor callous, nor ſunk in, but they muſt be raiſed, and have
ſeveral ſmall Holes that the Child may Suck without any great pains; ſhe
muſt have Milk ſufficient, and not in too great exceſs, becauſe the
Child not being able to draw it, it grows ſtale in the Breaſt, and by its
long ſtay there, turns ſour and curdles; and therefore ſhe may let
another Child ſuck the remainder. Her Milk muſt not be too thick nor too
wateriſh, which may be known by Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into the Hand, and the turning it
a little on one ſide, for if it run off immediately, it is a ſign it is too
Fluid, but if it do not run off at all, it is too thick; the good is of a
conſiſtence between both, which runs off gently in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the
inclining of the Hand, and leaves a Trace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it. The whiteſt Milk is the
beſt, and the farther any <pb n="274" facs="tcp:42110:153"/>recedes from that the worſe
it is, it ought to have a pleaſant ſmell, and ought to be well taſted,
that is, ſweet and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar'd without any Acrimony or Heat. But we muſt not
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get one principal condition of a good Nurſe, and that is, that ſhe be
an Honeſt and Conſcientious Woman, becauſe theſe qualities will make
her ſober and careful of her charge, and preſerve her from Drinking and
Venery.</p>

Crooked or Lame.</head>
                     <p>To prevent a Childs becoming Squint-eyed, chuſe a Nurſe
whoſe Sight is firm and ſtraight, leaſt by her ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he get a bad
Habit, Children being wondrous apt to imitate what they ſee done. Let his
Cradle be ever ſo placed, that he may always have the light before him,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when it is on one ſide, the Muſcles of the Eye are apt to act
independently on one another. To redreſs this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, let the Child
wear a Mask upon its Face with two ſmall Holes right againſt the Eyes to
ſee through, which will cauſe him perceiving no light but through them to
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Eyes that way, and by degrees quit the ill Habit he has got of
looking aſide.</p>
                     <p>To prevent the Childs growing crooked, awry or lame, the
Nurſe muſt ſwaddle his Body ſtrait, equally extending his Arms and
Legs, and Swathing his Body ſometimes one way, ſometimes another, leſt if
ſhe ſhould ſwaddle it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike, the parts ſhould retain an ill
Figure. The Nurſe muſt lay him on his Back ſtreight and not bending, and
when ſhe holds him in her Arms, let her carry him ſometimes upon one, and
ſometimes upon another, for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Legs always in the ſame Faſhion,
it would be a great Hazard if they did not grow crooked, and this
compreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſpecially about the Knees, is the cauſe why ſo many
Children have crooked Legs.</p>
                     <p>When any Parts have contracted an ill Figure from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
cauſe it proceed, let this be remedied with Swathes and Compreſſes
conveniently placed, to keep the Part in a good Poſture, whilſt the Child
is in his Clouts. When he is grown a little bigger, ſmall Leather Boots may
be uſed to ſtraighten the Legs; if the Foot only be awry, Shooes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
of one ſide higher than the other, will ſerve the turn. When the Breaſt
or Back-bone are in fault, it muſt be helped if poſſible, or at leaſt
hinder from growing worſe, <pb n="275" facs="tcp:42110:153"/>by a little Bodice of
ſtrong Whale-Bone very well lined on that ſide where it jets out. A Croſs
made of Steel is now in uſe, the Traverſe of which paſſes over both
Shoulders, and the perpendicular lengthways of the Body, this Inſtrument is
very convenient, and do's not appear.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who would ſeriouſly apply themſelves to the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mauriceau</hi> aſſures us, He delivered a Woman of a
Dead Child, which ſhe had retained in her Womb for two Months, after being
ſeverely exerciſed with a Violent Cough. Tho' the Child was entirely
ſtript of its Scarf-skin; yet it had not the leaſt ill Scent, being kept in
this manner from all manner of Cadaverous Putrefaction. The Mother retained it
to the end of the ninth Month, without any notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience (and
continued in perfect good Health till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Delivery.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author relates, <hi>Obſ.</hi> 465. that on the
21ſt of <hi>November,</hi> 1686. He laid a Woman nine Months gone with Child
of a Girl perfectly Sound, her Burthen appeared to be Sound, though the Mother
had in the Neck of the Womb ſeveral Miliary Puſtles and Yellow
Excreſcences, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly proceeded from a Virulent
<hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> which her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band probably had given her above a year
before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 422. He relates that on the 25th of
<hi>January,</hi> 1686. He happily delivered a Woman of a Male Child, the Child
was ſeized with a great Defluxion on the Head, cauſed by a great quantity
of cold Water which the Prieſt poured on the Mould in Baptizing him. This
cold Water created ſo great an Obſtruction, that it could not breath
through the Noſe, and therefore was incapable of Sucking, and obliged to quit
the Breaſt, as ſoon as it had taken it into its Mouth, and this killed the
Child in four days after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 692. He tells us a Woman Miſcatryed of a
<hi>Foetus</hi> wholly emaciated, which was about the length of a Mans Finger,
being about three Months gone, and this was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a great Clap of
Thunder which ſurprized her.</p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:42110:154"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 688. This Author mentions a Woman who was
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at Nine Months end of a Girl very ſound and well, though the
Mother voided near a Quart of Water in one Day, above two Months before, and
after voided a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity more at different times. He makes a
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether theſe Waters were the effect of a Dropſie, or were
really the Childs Waters, and concludes they could not be any other than a
Dropſie, becauſe the Child had been incapable of ſuſtaining ſuch a
loſs, and the Woman muſt of neceſſity have been delivered when the
firſt Waters came away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 489. He tells us he had laid a Woman of 35
years of Age, whoſe Hymen was entire, and only perforated with a ſmall
Hole, ſhe was with Child though her Husband could never break that Membrane,
and enter her Body, as ſhe her ſelf aſſured him. This Example makes it
evident, that a Woman may become big with Child without introducing the Yard,
and that it is ſufficient that the Seed be lodged within the Neck of the
Womb.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 393. He remarks, that a Woman of ſixteen
years of Age and a half was got with Child tho' ſhe never had had her
Courſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 20. He tells us that a Woman having had a
continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oppreſſion in the time of her going with Child, was bled four or
five times in the Arm, twice in the Foot, once in the Throat, notwithſtanding
which ſhe was delivered of a Healthy Child at her due time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 30. He tells us that a Woman of Eighteen years
of Age, was happily delivered at her due time of her firſt Child who was very
well, as the Mother her ſelf was, though ſhe had been bled Ninety times
during her going with Child, particularly in her eighth Month 22 times in the
Arm, and twice in the Foot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 23. He tells us that a Woman of 22 years of
Age, and ſeven Months gone with Child, underwent a Salivation for the cure of
a Pox; The Flux was ſo copious, that ſhe filled five or ſix Baſons
every Day. This Woman was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her Diſtemper, and at laſt happily
delivered at her due Term of a Healthy, Sound, Child, which perhaps would have
died of the Pox, if the Woman had not gone through this Courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 40. He relates that a Woman having a
<hi>Prolapſus</hi> of the Womb made uſe of a Peſſary, who was
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding got with Child, though ſhe did never take that
Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary out.</p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:42110:154"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 70. He tells us that a Woman who had been
Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical for the ſpace of nine Years, was notwithſtanding pregnant, and
when her time was up, delivered of a luſty Child; the Dropſie encreaſed
till the time of her Delivery, and ſhe had four Children whilſt her
Diſtemper was on her, amongſt which was a Girl who appeared to be ſeven
years of Age, when ſhe was really not above four and a half. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her
Delivery, her Belly did not ſink more than if a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets Egg had been

her Belly.</p>
                  <p>

two Ells of <hi>Paris</hi> meaſure in Circumference, was notwithſtanding
got with Child, and delivered ſeveral times when her time was up. This Woman
in good Health weighed 110 <abbr>lb.</abbr> and when ſhe had her Dropſie,
220. and yet had her Courſes very regularly. This Woman made Iſſues in
her Legs, whereby all the Water of her Body being evacuated, ſhe dyed within
a few days after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 105. He relates that a little Woman who had
had ſeveral Children, when ſhe was not with Child, would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten emit wind
with as great a Noiſe as from the <hi>Anus,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he had ſeen

                  <p>In <hi>Obſ.</hi> 174. He relates that a Woman having the
<hi>Nymphae</hi> exceſſively long, which was unpleaſing to her Husband,
and incommoded her very much in Riding, by rubbing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other, ſhe
cut them off and loſt twelve Porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Blood in five or ſix hours.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Obſ.</hi> 223. He mentions a Woman who ſeeing her

Senſes by the ſudden Fright, fell into a Flooding, and was delivered of a
falſe Conception.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 245. A Woman about ſix Months gone with
Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overturned in her Coach, and exceedingly affrighted by the
Accident, the Child in her Womb died, and continued there for the ſpace of a
Month, notwithſtanding which it was not much corrupted, being preſerved by
the Waters; for if theſe had come away, it muſt of neceſſity have

<hi>Foetus</hi> of five weeks old, which though no longer than his Nail, had
all its parts as perfectly formed, as one of nine Months.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 251. He relates, that a young Woman dying
after ſhe had been two days in Labour, not being able to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, the
Child which was very large preſenting its Head and one ſide of his Face,
was opened after her Death, and the Child was found dead; and though its Head
was in the paſſage, by its ſtrugling it had broke through the Womb, and
thruſt the Burthen into the cavity of the Lower Belly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 301. He mentions a Surgeon who cutting the
<hi>Fraenum</hi> in a Child that was Tongue-tyed, opened a Vein which pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out a great quantity of Blood, and this coagulating in the Stomach killed the
Infant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 315. He aſſures us he had ſeen a Woman
eight Months and a half gone with Child, who having had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous
Pleuriſie about two Months before, was ſiezed with a continual Feaver and
<hi>Delirium,</hi> of which ſhe dyed after ten days Illneſs. As ſoon as
ſhe was Dead, an Inciſion was made into the Womb, and a Child taken out
which lived about two Hours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 342. He mentions a Woman who entirely loſt
her Senſes upon hearing of the Death of her Child, about five or ſix Days
after her Delivery, who notwithſtanding became pregnant, and after was
happily delivered of another Child, and reſtored to the uſe of her
Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 383. He mentions a Woman of twenty years of
Age who being ſuppoſed by the bigneſs of her Belly to be with Child the
firſt time, and about ſix Months gone, had violent Vomitings, which after
ſome time were ſtaid by the bringing up a Worm as long as a Mans Hand;
after this ſhe fell into a Hectick Feaver and continual Looſneſs, with
which being very much waſted ſhe died. Upon opening the Body the left
Teſticle was bigger than a Mans Head, and filled the whole capacity of the
lower Belly, weighing fifteen pound, and was of a very compact Subſtance, the
Right Teſticle was as big as both a Mans Fiſts, containing in the midſt
of it a Glairy Matter, reſembling the White of an Egg. The Womb it ſelf was
no bigger than that of a Child of eight years old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bartholine</hi> and <hi>Foreſtus</hi> aſſure us,
that a Woman with Child having the Small Pox, was after delivered of a Child 
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42110:155"/>who had Scars, from whence it is evident that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Child had the Diſtemper both at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amatus Luſitanus, Centur.</hi> 5. tells us that a Woman
with Child having taken an Infuſion of <hi>Saffron,</hi> was after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of two Girls, whoſe whole Bodies were tinged yellow. This Accident gave
occaſion to ſome <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> to make the Experiment in a Bitch
whoſe Whelps became all yellow.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Miſcellanea Curioſa, Obſ.</hi> 42. there is a
Relation of a Woman in <hi>Hungary</hi> who being in Labour, and the
<hi>Foetus</hi> having his Head out, drew it back into the Womb, where it
continued a Fortnight longer, and after was born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ill Accident.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in his Experimental Philoſophy, relates
that a Child was heard to cry in his Mothers Belly.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Scholion</hi> to the 62 <hi>Obſ.</hi> of the
<hi>Miſcell. Curioſa,</hi> we are told that in the Year 1624. a Woman nine
Months gone with Child, heard her Child ſigh in her Belly whilſt ſhe was
at Church in the Town of <hi>Colberg,</hi> ſeveral Women beſides heard it.
After this Child was born, its Mother and it ſelf both were poiſoned by a
certain Perſon, her Husband died of the Plague, the Houſe in which ſhe
lived was fired, and a great part of the Family burnt, and others loſt there
Limbs, and not long after a terrible War broke out in that Country, all which
Miſchiefs the People did believe, this Childs crying did Preſage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory,

               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>an Inciſion into the Belly and Womb, to
take out the</hi> Foetus.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of this Operation is the largeneſs of the
<hi>Foetus,</hi> which cannot paſs by the Natural and Ordinary way, or
perhaps its breaking through the Womb, and ſo falling into the Belly, or the
Womb inſinuating it ſelf through the Rings of the Abdominal Muſcles.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The largeneſs of a Child is eaſily known, by the
Mothers Belly being exceſſively ſwelled. This may be farther evinced if
putting your Hand up into the Womb, you find there is an
<hi>Hydrocephalus.</hi> You may conclude the Womb has thruſt it ſelf
through the Rings of the Muſcles, if it be not in its proper place, and you
may believe the Child has forced its way into the Cavity of the Belly, if there
be nothing in the Womb, and you have certain indications of the Womans being
with Child.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Place the Woman on her Back, and then make a longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Inciſion below the Navel, and on one ſide the <hi>Linea Alba,</hi> and cut
through the Teguments till you lay the Womb bare; Be ſure to make the
Inciſion large enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and when this is done
make an Inciſion through the Body, and on one ſide the Womb put the
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger of the left Hand into the Inciſion to widen it, and guide the
Point of the Sciſſars or Knife on the Finger, to prevent hurting the Child;
then open the Membranes which contain the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and bring both it
and the Burthen away, after having dextrouſly diſingaged it. Wipe the Blood
off the Wound with a Spunge dipt in Wine warmed, and make a Suture of the
Belly, as in its proper place was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, without ſtitching the Womb at
all.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING is the ſame as in the <hi>Gaſtroraphia.</hi>
Put a Peſſary into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> for the more eaſie evacuating the

                  <p>THE CURE. Dreſs the Wound once a Day with ſome good

                  <head>REMARKS.</head>
                  <p>In the <hi>Journal des Scavans,</hi> there is a Relation of a
Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Chateau Thierry,</hi> who ſome years before being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lie
in, called in the Surgeon of the Place, who ſeeing her caſe very bad,
undertook to make the Caeſarean Section. The Mother was ſix Months under
Cure, and the Child liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 13 Months. The Woman ſometime after her Cure had a
<hi>Hernia Ventralis,</hi> which encreaſed to a great ſize, ſhe
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this Rupture with a Bandage hanging from her Shoulders, but the
Pain encreaſing with the Swelling, and this at laſt Ulceraring, forced her
to ſeek for a Cure in the <hi>Hôtel Dieu,</hi> where ſhe remained
three Months, in which time the Rupture roſe ſo high, that it ſuffocated
her. Mr. <hi>Saviard</hi> who was then Surgeon in that Hoſpital opened the
Body, found the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> connected to the <hi>Omentum</hi> and
ſmall Guts by ſeveral Membranous ties, and the <hi>Ileum</hi> and
<hi>Jejunum</hi> contained in the Swelling. He found a <hi>Cicatrix</hi> in the
Womb within and without, with ſome Membranous Skirts on the <hi>Cicatrix</hi>
within.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sennertus</hi> relates, that a Woman bending a Stick for
the Hooping of a Tub, one end ſprung back and hitting her a blow on the
Groin, broke the Muſcle of the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> by which means the. Womb
inſinuated it ſelf into the Groin in ſuch manner, that it could not be
reduced into its Natural Place. The Woman became Pregnant, and the Womb with
the <hi>Foetus</hi> in it hung between her Thighs, and there was no
poſſible way to deliver her without making an Inciſion, When the
Operation was over, the Womb could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into its Natural place, but
the Skin was brought over ſo as to cover it, and ſo it was Stitched. The
Womb leſſened by degrees till it came to its Natural ſize, but the Woman
after ſome time hapning to do ſome work, the Wound gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened and killed
her.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Of a</hi> Polypus.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Extraction of a Carnous excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
in the Noſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. A <hi>Polypus</hi> is a carnous excreſcence formed
in the cavity of the Noſe. For the better underſtanding the cauſe whence
this proceeds, we muſt conſider that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Membrane of the Noſe
is very thick, ſpungy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with a Viſcid, Glutinous Humour, and
that its Pores are ſo diſpoſed, as to admit the groſs and terreſtrial
parts of the Blood to paſs, and from the comparing theſe cauſes, it will
not be difficult to conceive the manner how theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences grow. For
by the encreaſing Heat of the Blood, and the Rapidity of its Motion, the
leſs viſcid parts exhale, and the reſt is condenſed into a hard
Subſtance, and when this is once formed being detained in the Membrane, it
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Veſſels, tumefies the Glands, and by the acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new
Matter, a Fungous Carcinomatous Maſs is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polypus</hi> ſometimes proceeds from an acrid
<hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> which corrodes the Glands and the <hi>Tubuli</hi> of the
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Membrane of the Noſe, and the Nutricious Juyce emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying it ſelf
there, is coagulated round the Orifice, and this concreted Lump is called a
<hi>Polypus,</hi> though ſometimes it is only a Maſs of tumefied Glands
which cohere together. The great Agent in this, is the Acidity of the Humours
which is the general cauſe of all Corroſion and Coagulation in Animal
Bodies.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of a <hi>Polypus</hi> are manifeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Carnous Excreſcence, which ſometimes comes out of the Noſe, and at other
times hangs down the Throat, hindring Reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſometimes
occaſioning great Fluxes of Blood.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Polypus</hi> are Schirrous, others Painful, and apt to
degenerate into Cancerous Ulcers; which laſt are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the effect
of ſome Venereal Diſtempers too long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; ſome are ſoft and of a
White or Red Colour. Theſe latter moſt commonly do not adhere ſo firmly,
and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence are cured with leſs difficulty.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:42110:157"/>
               <p>All Tumours in the Noſe muſt not preſently be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to be <hi>Polypus's,</hi> for ſometimes they are only attendants of an
<hi>Ozaena,</hi> which is an inveterate, ſordid, ſtinking Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the
Noſe, which emits an acrimonious ill coloured Matter, and cauſes great Pain
by its exceſſive ſharpneſs, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding the internal Membrane like an
<hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi> This Ulcer is covered with a large, moiſt Cruſt, from
which a thick foetid Matter diſtils and makes the Breath ſtink, infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe who come near it.</p>
               <p>This Ulcer like all others, proceeds from an Acrimony of the
Humours by which it corrodes the Membrane of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Polypus</hi> be not treated Skilfully, it degenerates
very often into a <hi>Cancer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome <hi>Polypus</hi>'s which fill the Noſtrils,
and when this happens, the Noſe becomes hard and Schirrous, and the Patient
cannot breath through the Mouth without blowing.</p>
               <p>If both Noſtrils be ſtopt, the Diſeaſe is incurable. If
the Excreſcence be hard, of a livid colour, painful, or adhere to the Bony
<hi>Lamellae</hi> of the Noſe, or be Cancerous, all tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring with it, in
ſtead of appeaſing, will exaſperate it. But if it be of a Fleſhy
Subſtance, Whitiſh or Red colour, and void of Pain, it may ſuffer the
Operation.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>This is done with a <hi>Forceps,</hi> which is to be
introduced into the Noſe, that ſo taking hold of the <hi>Polypus,</hi> and
turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inſtrument one way and another, you may pull it out by the
Roots.</p>
                  <p>If the Excreſcence be ſo large as to hang out of the
Noſe into the Mouth, you muſt extract it with the <hi>Forceps</hi> through
the Mouth. This is the way that a <hi>Polypus</hi> ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, as
often as it can be practiſed, becauſe by this means it is moſt eaſily
eradicated.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients conſumed <hi>Polypus's</hi> quite to the Roots,
with Potential or Actual Cauteries conveyed into the Noſe by a
<hi>Cannula;</hi> but theſe ways are grown obſolete, though they may have
their uſe when the <hi>Polypus</hi> has a large Baſis, and adheres firmly,
for in this caſe it would be impoſſible to bring it away with the
<hi>Forceps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. If a Haemorrhage enſue, ſtop it with 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42110:158"/>a Tent arm'd with aſtringent Powders, or Syringe the
Noſe with ſome Styptick Water.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If the leaſt Roots of the <hi>Polypus</hi> remain,
a new one will infallibly ariſe, and therefore Suppuration muſt be
encouraged to conſume them, and <hi>Savin</hi> or ſome other powders us'd
if that be not ſufficient. But obſerve here not to apply Cauſticks
without neceſſity to the <hi>Septum</hi> of the Noſtrils, and to lay
ſome Tent on to defend thoſe parts, which you would have remain
untoucht.</p>
                  <p>Since <hi>Polypus</hi>'s moſt commonly ariſe from the
ſharpneſs of the Blood, it is evident a good Diet muſt be kept to
ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it. To this end, let the Patient abſtain from all Acid, Salt, or
Pepper'd Meats; let him drink a Ptiſan made of Barley, and other Vulnerary
Ingredients; give him Alkali's and Sudorificks, as <hi>Powder of Vipers,</hi>
from ℈i. <hi>to</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs, <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick Antimony</hi> to the
ſame quantity, <hi>Blood of a Stag,</hi> from ℈ſs. upwards, which
may be taken ſeparately, or more of them together, to the quantity of
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>or</hi> ℈ij. in a Glaſs of <hi>Carduus Water.
Millepedes</hi> dried in an Oven and powder'd, are a very good <hi>Alkali,</hi>
and may be given in a Ptiſan. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zems of <hi>Guajacum, Salſa Parilla</hi>
and <hi>China</hi> are good Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, but when the Patient takes any of
theſe Medicines, he muſt keep his Bed and Sweat. Theſe Remedies muſt be
frequently repeated for the more effectual ſweetning of the Blood.</p>

                     <p>Though theſe are not <hi>Polypus's,</hi> yet it ſeems
very proper to refer them to this place. Theſe Ulcers are very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly
cured, all Mercurial Medicines are good in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which may be taken
from 15 to 30 or 40 grains in <hi>Conſerve of Roſes,</hi> and muſt be

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Of Amputation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Extirpation of a Member, when there is
ſome Gangrene, Mortification or Fracture, and the Bone is very much
ſhatter'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The difference between a Gangrene and
<hi>Sphacelus,</hi> or Mortification, is that one is incipient only, and the
other is compleat.</p>
               <p>Theſe Accidents ariſe from a defect in the due
diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood and Spirits to the Part. Inflammations of a part
ill treated, and the Application of Emplaſters hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tranſpiration, and
by conſequence the Blood Stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="286" facs="tcp:42110:159"/>corrupts, and the
part Mortifies, which at firſt is only a Gangrene, but after becomes a
<hi>Sphacelus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When there is an interruption in the Motion of the Heart, the
Blood do's not duely circulate, and the Spirits not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtributed to the
Extreme parts, they become chill, the Face grows pale or livid, and the Limbs
loſe their Senſe and Motion. On the contrary, as ſoon as the Heart
reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers its Motion, the Blood freely circulates through the Parts, and they
are reſtored to their Senſe, Motion, and Natural Colour From all which it
is moſt evident, that the Life of an Animal conſiſts in the free
Circulation of the Blood through every part, and the Mortification occaſioned
by exceſſive Cold, or ſtrict Ligature in Fractures of the Bones, which
ſtop its Motion are demonſtrative proofs which confirm this
Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Gangrenes ſometimes proceed from Obſtructions of the Nerves,
becauſe for want of a free ſupply of Spirits, the Parts loſe their
Senſe and Motion, and by conſequence the Influx of the Blood ceaſes; This
is clear in Paralytick. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in whom the parts affected ever gangrene
firſt. From which I infer, that the cauſes of Gangrenes are a deficience of
Blood and Spirits, ariſing from ſome coagulation of this Vital Liquour, or
other impediment in its Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This is illuſtrated by comparing the Blood with any Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Liquour. For all Wines whilſt they retain their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits continue to be
potable, and preſerve an eaſie and gentle Fermentation; but when once the
Spirits are exhaled, and the acid parts prevail over the reſt, they loſe
their ſweet and pleaſant Taſt, become eager and ſour, and ſometimes
only a dead inſipid Phlegm. How much the Spirituous parts conduce to the good
Temper of the Maſs, is evident in the diſtillation of Wine; for when
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Spirituous Parts are
drawn off, the remainder is a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e nauſeous and uſeleſs Phlegm. It happens juſt after the
ſame manner in the Blood of Animals; for when the Spirituous Parts are
loſt, the reſt becomes a heavy unactive Maſs, bereaved of that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
which ſhould preſerve a gentle Fermentation in it.</p>
               <p>When any part ſuffers by intenſe Cold, eſpecially the
Extremities, the Circulation is intercepted, by reaſon of the conſtriction
of the ſmall Veſſels, and when the quantity of the Blood imported is ſo
very ſmall, the parts muſt needs <pb n="287" facs="tcp:42110:159"/>ſuffer a
Diminution of their Senſe and Motion, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence Gangrene.</p>
               <p>Men who die of exceſſive Age, are moſt commonly ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with a Gangrene, becauſe their Blood loſes all its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are the
true <hi>Humidum Radicale;</hi> and for the ſame reaſon Mortifications
happen after Exceſſive Labour, Looſneſſes of a long continuance, or
long Faſting, in ſhort, whatever waſts the Spirits.</p>
               <p>Gangrenes often ſeize the Feet and <hi>Scrotum</hi> of
Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſons, becauſe their Blood is ſerous and wants Spirits, and
there is leſs Heat in the extreme parts, beſides the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities
compreſſing the Channels which Nature has formed for the conveying of the
Blood to all parts of the Body, muſt neceſſarily intercept its
Motion.</p>
               <p>The aptneſs of parts which ſuffer by extreme cold to
gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, proceeds as well from a concentration of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>its, as an obſtruction in the Motion of the
Blood, which is plain by the inſtance of a Bottle of Wine, which if it be
expoſed to the Air in a vehement Froſt, the Watry and more groſs unactive
parts will be frozen all round, and the more Spirituous and Fine ones remain
liquid in the Center, nor can it be imagined but exceſſive Cold muſt have
a like effect on Animal Bodies.</p>
               <p>The Back and Buttocks of Perſons who are forced to keep their
Beds for a long time often gangrene, and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from a Compreſſion
of the Veſſels, which not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Blood enough, and by conſequence the
Part want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a due ſupply to animate it, muſt neceſſarily grow cold
and mortifie.</p>
               <p>Great Inflammations, Contuſions and Aneuriſms,
(eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if there be Blood ſpilt in the interſtices of the Fibres)
very often terminate in a Gangrene, and this is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to account for,
becauſe the Extravaſated Blood putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, muſt neceſſarily
compreſs the ſmall Chanels, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the Motion of the reſt, and it
is evident that this is ſo, becauſe the Pulſation ceaſes in proportion
as the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene encreaſes, and the part loſing its Natural colour,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes pale or livid.</p>
               <p>When Olcons, Greaſy, or Aſtringent Medicines are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
Inflammations or <hi>Eryſipelas's,</hi> they moſt commonly gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,
becauſe the Oyly parts ſtop the Pores and hinder Tranſpiration, and there
being a continual congeſtion of Matter in the part which cannot be
diſcharged, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily compreſs the Veſſels, and hinder
the influx of the <pb n="288" facs="tcp:42110:160"/>Blood and Spirits. The Miſchief of
Aſtringent Medicines, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſame reaſon, and in the Hot
Countries where the Pores are more open, Gangrenes do not ſo frequently
happen after Inflammations, as in colder Climates.</p>
               <p>Gangrenes after an Inflammation, are more apt to ſeize on
ſoft and ſpungy parts, as the Gums, Lips, Genitals or Brain, than on the
ſolid, which do not imbibe ſo great a quantity of Humours.</p>
               <p>Gangrenes ſometimes enſue on Ulcers, Wounds, Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Spots, or ſharp or corroſive Medicines, becauſe theſe being attended
with Pain, an Inflammation of neceſſity muſt follow.</p>
               <p>Carbuncles moſt commonly Mortifie, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from exceſſive ſharp Humours, which like an <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> corrode the Veſſels
and the Parts. In the laſt place, when the Humours of the Body grow ſharp
and corroſive, they frequently leave a Mortification behind them, as we ſee
happen in Malignant Feavers, in the Small Pox, and many other Diſtempers
where the Humours are very much corrupted.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. In Gangrenes which ſeize ſuperannuated Perſons,
ariſing from a deficience of Spirits, there is no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Heat or
Inflammation, the Part withers, loſes its Senſe and Motion, and the
Perſon dies gradually.</p>
               <p>When a Gangrene follows on a Dropſie, the Pain at firſt is
very ſlight; but afterwards the Leggs are inflamed, and it encreaſes. When
a Gangrene proceeds from external Cold, the Pain is very acute; at firſt the
Part becomes red, livid, and afterwards black, the Spirits abandon it, and a
Mortification enſues with a ſhivering Fit, not unlike that intermitting
Feaver. If the Gangrene proceed from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Ligature, Tumours, or
Luxations, or Fractures, or long lying on the Back, there is a Stupor, and a
perfect pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Senſe and Motion.</p>
               <p>If a Gangrene follows an Inflammation, the Pain and Pulſation
ceaſe, the Part becomes of a pale red or violet colour; there are a great
many <hi>Veſicul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> or
ſmall Blebs ariſe on the Surface of the Skin, which are filled with a Salt
Muddy Water, the Natural Heat is extinguiſhed, and the Part becomes ſoft
and flabby, and retains the impreſſion of the Finger. If the Mortification
be perfected, the Patient falls into a great <hi>Languor,</hi> attended with a
Burning and Malignant Feaver, Vomiting, and other Symptoms which plainly
diſcover Death is not far off. Theſe Accidents <pb n="289" facs="tcp:42110:160"/>happen
upon the applying, Repelling and Emplaſtick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>When a Gahgrene happens upon the uſe of an Actual Cautery, or
other Cauſtick Medicines the Part is benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and loſes its Senſe and
Motion. When it proceeds from any Malignant Matter, as in the Bites of Venomous
Creatures, there is a Mortification of the part, a Feaver, Vomiting,
<hi>Delirium</hi> and <hi>Syncope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Signs of a <hi>Sphacelus</hi> or perfect Mortification, are
a heavineſs in the Part, Blackneſs, Stench, the Fleſh is flabby, has no
Senſe, the Skin ſeparates from it, and it grows dry. Sometimes a part which
is perfectly Mortified, does not preſently loſe its Motion, which proceeds
not ſo much from it ſelf, as the Muſcles which move it being fixed to a
ſound part. There are ſome Puſtules which ariſe on the Skin, becauſe
when the Blood Stagnates in the part, there comes a ſharp corroſive
<hi>Serum</hi> from it, which inſinuating it ſelf under the Skin,
ſeparates it, raiſes it, and forms theſe ſmall Eruptions. There is no
Pulſation in the Part, and it becomes pale and livid, becauſe the
Circulation of the Blood in the Part cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and being extravaſated it
putrefies. The Pains pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the irritation of the Membranes and Nervous
Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres by the corroſive <hi>Serum,</hi> and they ceaſe when the load of
extravaſated Matter preſſes on the Nerves, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the Motion of
the Spirits through their proper Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels. The great quantity of Seroſities
which moiſten the Fibres, make the Part ſoft and flabby; add to this, that
upon a Ceſſation of the Influx of the Blood and Spirits, the Parts muſt
neceſſarily be relaxed.</p>
               <p>The Acids which corrode and deſtroy the Neighbouring parts,
aſſiſt the Mortification in its progreſs. If an Ulcer mortifie
(beſides the forementioned Signs) it emits no Matter, or at leaſt what it
do's is ill colour'd, and has a Stench.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Sphacelus</hi> is incurable, except by an exciſion of
the Mortified part. A Gangrene or Mortification ariſing from an internal
Cauſe is curable, becauſe though you ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the part, the
Gangrene would be reproduced in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fleſhy parts replete with Blood are
more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd than any others, on the contrary Nervous parts are
more apt to Gangrene, and cured with more difficulty.</p>
               <p>A Gangrene proceeding from an external cauſe, muſt be cured
with all ſpeed, and prevented from ſpreading it ſelf. That which ſiezes
Superannuated Men and Hydropical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <pb n="290" facs="tcp:42110:161"/>is incurable,
and the Amputation of the Member would be altogether uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>A Gangrene in the ſoft internal Parts, is very apt to
Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celate.</p>
               <p>Gangrenes are much ſooner cured in young than in old
Perſons, and in Robuſt, than in weak Men. Thoſe which proceed from
intenſe Cold, and ſeize the extreme parts only are curable, provided the
part be not Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>Gangrenes occaſioned by great Inflammations, Tumours,
Fractures, Luxations, Contuſions, Aneuriſms, <hi>Eryſipelas</hi>'s,
Ulcers, Burns, Scorbutick Spots, Bites of Venomous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Application of
Unctuous Medicines, Cauſticks, Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cauteries or Compreſſion may be
cured in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>The Operation muſt not be undertaken on ſlight occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and a Surgeon muſt conſider well whether there be a probability of
Succeſs; for inſtance, if the Mortification be on the upper part of the
Thigh, it would not be adviſable to meddle with it at all, becauſe it is
too near the large Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and Parts neceſſary to Life. It would not
be proper to perform it when there is a High Feaver, with Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a
<hi>Syncope,</hi> becauſe theſe are Mortal Symptoms, but it may be
practiſed in Carioſities and <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> of long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in
the Joynts, or when the Bone is entirely broke, and the Splinters run into the
Fleſh and Tendons, and prick ſome Nerves or Blood-Veſſels, and cannot
eaſily be reduced to their Natural place; but if they can be reduced, and the
Inſlammation be not very conſiderable, forbear Amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Complicate Wounds are difficultly cured, and eſpecially in ill
Subjects, and there is great reaſon to fear Pain and Inſlammation, which
are often attended with bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>
               <p>When Carioſities and <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> ariſe from any
Hurt, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions, or cruſhing of the Parts, whilſt they are recent, do
not affect the Joynts, and the Humour which produces them is void of all
Maliguity; you muſt try to cure them by Medicines, and not proceed to an
Amputation of the Part preſently.</p>
               <p>But if the Diſtemper proceed from ſome Screphulous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
or ſome Abſceſs or Ulcer which is the <hi>Criſts</hi> of the Feaver or
an Univerſal Corruption of the Blood, or if they are of long ſtanding in
the Joynt, or the Carioſity, Pain and <pb n="291" facs="tcp:42110:161"/>Inflammation are
very conſiderable, and the part diſabled from performing its Natural
Functions, it muſt be extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if the Patients has ſtrength enough to
undergo the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But before you proceed to it, let the Blood be
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and ſweetned by general Remedies, Sudoriſicks and Cordials.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>A Limb muſt never be cut off in the Joint, without a
Viſible neceſſity for it.</p>
                  <p>The Leg muſt be cut off as near the Knee as is poſſible,
though the Mortification ſpread no farther than the Foot, for the more
commodious carrying a Wooden Legg. The moſt proper place for this purpoſe,
is about four fingers breadth below the Joynt, preciſely beneath the
Termination of the Tendons which cover the <hi>Rotula.</hi> On the contrary cut
as little as may be off the Arm, becauſe it ſerves as an Ornament and
Counterpoiſe to the Body, and an Artificial Hand may be made to be uſeful
in ſome caſes. Cut off as little of the Thigh as is poſſible, that the
Digeſtion of the Wound may be made in a ſhorter time, and the Patient have
ſtrength enough to undergo the Cure.</p>
                  <p>To cut off the Legg, let the Patient ſit in a Chair or on
the ſide of his Bed, and let one Servant hold him behind, and another ſtand
before to hold his Leg, then draw the Skin below the Knees up, that ſo it may
the more eaſily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Bone after the Operation is over. Then make two
Ligatures, one above the Knee, which you muſt ſtraiten with the Turnſtick
or <hi>Tourniquet,</hi> and the other above it. The firſt Ligature ſerves
to compreſs the Veſſels, ſtop the Flux of Blood, and take off the
Senſe of the Part. Theſe Ligatures muſt be made on a thick Compreſs
laid along the Ham, and before you ſtraiten the Ligature above the Knee with
the Stick, you muſt lay a ſmall Paſt-board under it, to hinder it from
pinching the Skin, and being painful to the Patient. This way is very uſeful
to command the Blood, and let out as little or much of it as you judge
convenient after the Amputation. The Ligature below the Knee ſerves to keep
the Fleſh ſteddy, and ought to be placed at leaſt four fingers breadth
below the Joynt.</p>
                  <p>When the Knee is ſteddy, let the Surgeon place himſelf
between the Patients Leggs, and with a crooked Knife make an Inciſion around
quite to the Bone, and to do it better, <pb n="292" facs="tcp:42110:162"/>let him make it
with his right Hand, reſting his Left on the Back of the Knife, which for
this reaſon muſt not have an edge there; Let him ſcrape off the
<hi>Perioſteum</hi> with a ſlender ſtraight Knife, and cut the Fleſh
between the Bones with it, leaſt if he tear them with the Saw, he cauſe
ſome farther Accidents.</p>
                  <p>Before you ſaw the Bone, take a Fillet and ſlit it
length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the middle, then put the two ends on the Fleſh which is cut,
and draw it up to make way for the Saw, and then ſaw the Bone as near the
Fleſh as poſſibly you can, for this ſhrinking and waſting in the
Digeſtion, without this way of prevention would remain uncovered, and create
the Patient abundance of Trouble.</p>
                  <p>Let the Surgeon take the Leg in his left Hand, and the Saw in
his Right, and fix it at once on both Bones, and then begin with the leſſer
Focil and end with the greater, for if he ſhould begin with the
<hi>Tibia</hi> firſt, the other would not be able to ſuſtain the Saw, but
moving to and fro would tear the Fleſh; Let the Saw at firſt be a little
incliped and ſaw gently, but after faſter. Whilſt the Surgeon Saws the
Bones, let a Servant who holds the Leg by the Foot bend it, and bring it a
little againſt the Saw to facilitate its Paſſage. When the Bones are
ſawed through, take off the Ligature which kept the Fleſh ſteddy below
the Knee, and looſen the Stick, and let ſuch a quantity of Blood out as you
judge the Patients Strength can bear, and then ſtop it by the
Dreſſings.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSINGS looſen the Turniket a little, that ſo you
may diſcover the Orifices of the Arteries, and then lay a Vitriol Button on
them; Let one the Aſſiſtants keep theſe Buttons on, as well as the dry
Pledgits laid on the Bone, whilſt you cover them with a great Pledgit of Tow
armed with Aſtringent Powders, as <hi>Bole Armoniack</hi> Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
<hi>Dragons Blood, Frankincenſe,</hi> and a Thouſand ſuch like things;
lay this in the Palm of your Hand, and at once apply it on the Stump. Some
cover this with a large Hogs bladder armed with Styptick Medicines, and lay
over all a Compreſs cut in form of a Croſs, applying its middle or plain
part on the Stump, and its ends on the Legg. Next there muſt be three
Compreſſes applied which muſt be of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent breadth, and about the
third part of an Ell in length, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Part, one of theſe is
to be laid to the Hamm, and ſo brought over the Stump, and applied to the
Knee, the middle of the Second is to be applied to the Stump, and ſo
diſpos'd as to croſs the other, and the third to be laid on the extremity
of the Stump, making a turn round the Leg.</p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:42110:162"/>
                  <p>To keep the Dreſſings on, take a Roller of three Ells in
breadth, and more than two Inches broad, rolled up at one end, apply it firſt
to the edge of the Stump, and make two turns about it, and then mount to the
Knee aſcending ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and pin it where it ends without binding the
Knee, but whether this be above or below the Knee, it matters not very
much.</p>
                  <p>When you have done this, take another Roller of more than two
Inches broad and four Ells long, rolled up at both ends, and applying the
midſt of the Roller on the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Stump, bring both Heads up to the
Knee, and make a turn round the part with one Head to ſtay the other, which
you muſt bring ſtrait down and ſo over the Wound, then bring it up and
with the other Head make a round to keep it firm and ſteddy, and thus you
muſt continue to do till the Stump be covered, ſtill keeping one end above
the Knee to make ſeveral Rounds, for the keeping the other ſteddy, but when
the ſtump is covered, make ſeveral Rounds about the Part, with the Heads
alternately to keep the aſcending and deſcending turns ſteady, and in the
laſt place pin them above the Knee.</p>
                  <p>Some Practitioners prefer a Ligature of the Arteries to the
Vitriol Button, for ſtopping the Blood. If you would practiſe this way, you
may proceed in this manner. Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Turniket to diſcover the place
whence the Blood iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, and when you have found this take hold of them
with a <hi>Forceps</hi> made with a little Ring to riſe and fall, for the
holding them firm at pleaſure. This ſort of <hi>Forceps</hi> is very
convenient for apprehending the Artery, and when you have hold of it, take a
crooked Needle with a wax Thread, and having paſſed it into the Fleſh
below the Artery, with the two ends tie the Veſſel, and then laying a
ſmall Compreſs waxed on it, faſten it by two other knots; when you have
done this looſen the Turniket to ſee if there be any other Arteries, and if
there be, tie them in the ſame manner as the firſt. After the Ligatures are
all made, take off the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niket, and bring the Fleſh as far as you can to
cover the Stump, and proceed to dreſs it as is above directed, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the
Vitriol Buttons and other Stypticks, which are not neceſſary, except ſome
little Artery, (as moſt commonly it does) happen to bleed, and in this caſe
you may apply ſome ſlight Styptick.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. When the Operation is over, let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be laid
down, and let the Part be kept ſupported on a <pb n="294" facs="tcp:42110:163"/>Pillow.
If Vitriol Buttons have been applied, and no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature made on the Veſſels,
the Hand muſt be kept on the Stump the firſt Day for the better applying
Medicines, and preventing a Flux of Blood. But in caſe Ligatures be made,
this is needleſs, at leaſt it is not neceſſary to continue the Hand on
for ſo long a time.</p>
                  <p>Some uſe the Actual Cautery to ſtop the Blood, but in this
way when the Eſcar ſeparates the Arteries, open and pour out Blood
afreſh, which often occaſions the loſs of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Life.</p>
                  <p>If the Blood be ſtopped with Vitriol Buttons, the
Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings muſt not be taken off till two Days after the Amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Stypticks which are applied, may have time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cloſe the
Veſſels (whereas on the contrary if a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be made, the Dreſſings
may be taken off the firſt day, without danger of a Haemorrhage) and the
Second Dreſſing muſt be made in the ſame manner as the firſt,
omitting the Hogs Bladder and Vitriol Buttons, and only ſtrewing on
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent Powders. The Dreſſings muſt be removed as gently as may be,
for fear of exciting a Haemorrhage. When you are once ſecure from any Flux of
Blood, it is then time to remove the Dreſſings, and endeavour to procure a
good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion with <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Yelks of Eggs,</hi> and when
you have obtained that, deterge with <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent de

whole Cure.</p>
                  <p>When the Digeſtion is over, lay Compreſſes on the
ſtump to preſs the Part, and hinder the Growth of Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and
Luxuriant Fleſh, which uſually happens at that time.</p>
                  <p>When the Part is convulſed after the Operation, as
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is from the vehemence of the Pain, and the Hurry and Diſorder
of the Spirits, let not the Artiſt loſe time by endeavouring to make a
Ligature on the Arteries, but let him immediately apply the Vitriol Button to
the Part, and Pledgits dipt in ſome Styptick Water.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>Fabricius Hildanus's</hi> Proceſs in
Amputations. In the firſt place he do's not remove the Dreſſings till the
third Day, unleſs the Pain be very urgent, but he embrocates the remaining
Stumps of the Limb twice a Day, with a Mixture of <hi>Oyl of Roſes</hi> and
<hi>Myrtlis,</hi> laying Defenſatives on the Neighbouring Parts. After the
Second Dreſſing when he is ſecure from any Haemorrhage, he lays aſide
Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and applies the following, or ſome like Digeſtive.

                  <p>When the Wound is deterged, he draws down the Skin and Fleſh

he makes after this or the like manner. ℞. <hi>Fine Flour,</hi> ℥i.

Agglutinative Emplaſter falls off, he applies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>During the whole Cure, he is careful not to ſuffer any Oyly
thing to touch the Bone, uſing the Actual Cautery to it to procure
Exfoliation, but withal, being careful not to touch the Marrow for fear of
Inflammation, and defending the Bone with dry Lint, till Nature has inveſted
it with Fleſh. If any Fleſhy Excreſcence happens to ariſe, he
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes it with a Mixture compos'd of <hi>Burnt Alum,</hi>

                  <p>Some time ſince a young Man in the <hi>Hôtel Dieu</hi>
had his Legg cut off, upon the account of a fierce Gangrene on it, but the
Wound it ſelf gangren'd again, and the Surgeons were forced to cut off the
Thigh. At firſt he ſeemed to <pb n="296" facs="tcp:42110:164"/>do well, but ſoon
after a large hard Swelling aroſe on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Thigh, which
extended quite to the Groin, this in ſome ſmall time gangrened, and killed
the Patient. This Obſervation ſhews, that internal Gangrenes are
incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that it is not enough to take care of Dreſſing the Part
outwardly, but great regard muſt be had to the Blood to ſweeten that, which
ſometimes is as ſharp and corroſive as an <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Paronychia <hi>or</hi>
Whitlow.</head>
               <p>THE Operation in <hi>Paronychia's,</hi> is an <hi>Apertion of
the extremity of the Finger to let out the</hi> Pus, <hi>which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is
lodged under the</hi> Perioſteum.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. A <hi>Paronychia</hi> is a Tumour at the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Finger, and Root of the Nails on the third Joynt, though ſometimes it
is found on others.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Paronychia's;</hi> in the one the
Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is between the Bone and <hi>Perioſteum;</hi> and in the other between
the Muſcles; and both commonly proceed from a ſharp corroſive Humour.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. When a <hi>Paronychia</hi> is lodged under the
<hi>Perioſteum,</hi> there is a burning Heat, a ſharp Pain, a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
within the Part, a great Tenſion, and an Acute Feaver. When it is only
between the Muſcles, there is leſs Heat and Pain, the Pulſation is not
ſo deep, nor the Tenſion ſo great, and the Feaver is leſs.</p>
               <p>The Heat and Pain proceed from the great Ebullition of the
Blood, and the Acrimony of the Matter which moleſts the Fibres of the
<hi>Perioſteum.</hi> The Tenſion ariſes from the Fermentation and
Rarefaction of the Humours, for when any Matter is in Motion, ſince the Parts
ſhock and mutually repulſe each other, they muſt needs leave Vacuities
between them, and by conſequence the Matter muſt occupy a greater ſpace,
and compreſs the Neighbouring Veſſels. The Pain and Pulſation proceeds
from the Arteries, beating and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on a ſenſible Part, which is
pained and inflamed, and it cannot be conceived, but that the repeated
ſtrokes muſt neceſſarily encreaſe the Symptoms; The Feaver proceeds 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42110:164"/>from the ſharp Humour of the <hi>Paronychia</hi> being
abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Blood, and communicating a Vitious Taint to it.</p>
               <p>There is reaſon to believe the Tumour to be ripe, and the
<hi>Pus</hi> fir to be let out, when the Symptoms ceaſe or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>This conſiſts in evacuating the <hi>Pus,</hi> and making
an Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the ſide of the Finger quite down to the Bone, for the
<hi>Perioſteum</hi> muſt neceſſarily be opened, if the Matter be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>odged under it. The
Inciſion as I remarked before, muſt be made on the ſide, to avoid cutting
the Tendons with the Lancet.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Put a ſmall Tent and a little Pledgit arm'd
with ſome good Digeſtives into the Wound, and cover theſe with an
Emplaſter in form of a Croſs, then lay over this a Compreſs cut in the
ſame Figure, and let the center be applied on the Extremity of the Finger,
lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ends along on the ſides, and keep all on with a Fillet three
quarters of an Inch broad, and about a quarter of an Ell in length; there
muſt be a little Hole made at one end of the Fillet, and the other end muſt
be ſlit three Inches in length; when it is thus diſpos'd paſs the ſlit
end thro' the Hole, and ſo bring the Fillet ſtrait to the Finger, and then
wind it ſpirally round, aſcending and deſcending gradually. If the
Surgeon pleaſes, he may make a Caſe of the Skin of any Animal to keep the
Fingers warm, and faſten this Caſe to the Wriſt with ſmall Ribbons.</p>
                  <p>It is very convenient to keep the Arm in a Sling, which may be
made of black Taffeta, otherwiſe a Napkin will ſerve well enough for this
purpoſe. Put the middle of the Napkin under the Patients Arm-pits, and bring
the two low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ends over the oppoſite Shoulder, then wrap the Arm in the
Napkin half folded with the Elbow down and the Hand a little raiſed and the
Thumb uppermoſt, then bring the two upper ends of the Napkin over the other
Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and order it ſo that it may ſit neatly.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Procure a good Digeſtion with proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
as <hi>Turpentine</hi> or <hi>Oyl of Eggs,</hi> forbearing all greaſie things
which are apt to rot the Tendons, and then deterge the Ulcer.</p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:42110:165"/>
                  <p>To cure the Tumour without proceeding to Operation, you muſt
endeavour to appeaſe the Pain with the <hi>Liquor</hi> of <hi>Worms</hi>
baked in an Oven, <hi>Balſam of Sulphur</hi> is good to diſcuſs this
Painful Tumour, or bring it to Suppuration, when it is diſpoſed. A Liniment
made of <hi>Ear-wax</hi> and <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> with a little <hi>Oyl
of Filberds</hi> is excellent, and ſo is a Cataplaſm of <hi>Human
Dung.</hi>

<hi>Cows Milk.</hi> Afterwards he took off the Surface of the Skin, and there

               <p>THIS is an <hi>Artificial Diviſion of the Skin, by means of
ſome Cauſticks laid on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSES. The occaſions which require Cauſticks, are
uſually ſome Diſtempers of long ſtanding, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed by
other Medicines, as Catarrhs, Tumours, Arthritick Pains, Calloſities in
Ulcers, Abſceſſes not ripe, when ſome indications require them to be
opened, and in general they are uſeful for purifying the Blood, and
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging all Superfluous Moiſture.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which indicate the application of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, are
all or any of thoſe Cauſes above-named.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When you intend to apply a Cauſtick to any Part, firſt lah
on an Emplaſter with a Hole in the midſt, of the ſame ſize and ſhape
you deſign the Eſcar, and then having wet the skin with a little Spittle
bruiſe the Cauſtick and lay it on, covering it with another Emplaſter,
and leaving it for a longer or a leſſer time, according to the thickneſs
of the Patients Skin, and the Strength of the Medicine.</p>
                  <p>The moſt proper places for the application of Cauſticks in
making of Iſſues are in the Neck, between the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Vertebra,</hi> in the Arm on the outſide, in a little Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the
<hi>Biceps</hi> and <hi>Deltoides</hi> Muſcle, in the inner part of the Thigh
in a ſmall place between the <hi>Sartorius</hi> and <hi>Vaſtus
internus,</hi> in the internal part of the Knee, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the
Termination of the Flexors of the Leg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The principal things to
be regarded in Iſſues are, That as much as poſſible they be in a Place
where the Patient may dreſs them himſelf: That they be near the great
Veſſels, that ſo there may be a great diſcharge; and in the laſt
place, that they be in the Interſtice of two Muſcles, as remote from the
Tendons as may be.</p>
                  <p>To make a good Cauſtick, take one part of <hi>Calx
viva,</hi> and two parts of <hi>Pot Aſhes,</hi> put theſe in an Earthen
Pot, pour hot Water on them, leaving them in Infuſion five or ſix Hours,
after that boil them, and filter that which is clear <pb n="300" facs="tcp:42110:166"/>through a Brown paper, and evaporate it in a Copper Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or an
Earthen pan glazed. There will remain a Salt at the Bottom, which you muſt
put in a good Crucible and melt it, keeping it in a ſtrong heat, till the
Moiſture be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled. When you find it is reduced to the form of an Oyl in
the Bottom, caſt it into a Baſon and cut it into parts of what ſize and
ſhape you pleaſe whilſt it continues hot, and put theſe into a ſtrong
Glaſs Bottle, ſtopping it with Wax and a Bladder, becauſe the Air ſoon
reſolves the Cauſtick into a <hi>Fluor,</hi> and for the ſame reaſon it
muſt be kept in a dry place. Theſe are the ſtrongeſt Cauſticks of
all, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their effect in the ſpace of half an Hour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lapis Infernalis</hi> is very uſeful, for
conſuming Luxuriant and Superfluous Fleſh by lightly paſſing it over
them. To make this, Diſſolve in a Glaſs Veſſel what quantity of
<hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> you pleaſe, with about thrice the ſame quantity of good
<hi>Spirit of Nitre;</hi> ſet this Veſſel in a ſand Heat, and
evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate about two thirds of the Liquour, then pour the reſt hot into a
good German Crucible, which muſt be pretty large by reaſon of the
ebullition which is made, place this on a ſmall Fire, and leave it there till
the Matter, which is very much rarified, ſinks to the Bottom, then increaſe
the Fire, and it will become like an Oyl, pour this into an Ingot well
greaſed and heated and it will coagulate, and may be kept in a Glaſs well
ſtopt. This Stone may be made with a Mixture of Copper and Silver, but then
it will not keep for ſo long a time. If you put in an Ounce of Silver, you
will have an Ounce and five Drams of this Cauſtick.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING conſiſts in covering the Cauſtick with an
Emplaſter to keep it on the part, and then laying a Compreſs over that,
binding all on with a Roller more than two Inches broad. After the Cauſtick
has lain on for a ſufficient time, take off the Dreſſings and ſcarifie
the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcar with a Lancet, laying on ſome good Digeſtive or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
freſh Butter, continuing this till the Eſcar begin to ſeparate, and then
if you deſign to make an Iſſue put in a ſmall Pea or a little
<hi>Orrice Root</hi> round, and keep this on with a ſmall Compreſs and
Bandage, the Bandage muſt be made of Linnen Cloth, long enough to go round
the Arm, and three or four Inches broad, and on the Hem or Edge of this there
muſt be two or three Holes made to put Ribbons through, and this Bandage is
very convenient, <pb n="301" facs="tcp:42110:166"/>becauſe the Patient can dreſs
theſe Iſſues himſelf, and draw it as ſtrait as he judges
convenient.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Ulcer muſt be dreſt twice a Day, putting in
a new pea of <hi>Orrice</hi> every time, and the Cloth changed every time to
prevent its ſtinking. If proud Fleſh grow in the Iſſue, let it be
conſumed with burnt <hi>Alum.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Of Cupping and Scarifying.</head>
               <p>WET Cupping is the <hi>Scarifying of the Back, to bring the
Blood and Spirits into the Part by the help of a great Glaſs Vial filled with
lighted Tow, and applied on the Scarifications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dry Cupping <hi>is without Scarification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Cupping is uſeful in Apoplexies, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies,
Hyſterick Fits, Palſies, Contractions of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Tendons which
ſometimes happen after Fractures and Diſlocations, becauſe when the part
is warmed and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refied, its Pores open themſelves, and receive in the more
Subtil parts of the Medicines applied to it.</p>
               <p>The Ancients applied Cupping-glaſſes to Venereal
<hi>Bubo's,</hi> Peſtilential Tumours, and the Bites of venomous Animals to
draw the Venom out of the Part, but later Authors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of this
Practice, becauſe, ſay they, the Poyſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating it ſelf into the
Maſs of Blood, a Cupping-glaſs is not capable of putting a ſtop to the
Miſchief; others again reject Cupping-glaſſes on all occaſions
whatever, denying that Scarifications determine the Blood and Spirits towards
the Part which is Cupped, or that by diverting the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours another way, the
ſuffering Part is thereby eaſed, and its Inflammation abated. Thoſe who
oppoſe this Practice tells us, that if this were true, the part which is
cupped would appear inflamed, becauſe it is not poſſible that the Blood
and Spirits ſhould flow very plentifully to a Part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a viſible
Inflammation of it, which nevertheleſs in this caſe is not diſcernible.
Beſides if any ſuch Inflammation ſhould ariſe, the Motion of the Blood
would be interrupted by a Diviſion of the Veſſels, as it happens in all
recent Wounds, and not be determin'd thither by the Pain or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the
Cupping-glaſſes. Whence they conclude, that once letting Blood or taking
any Sudoriſick or other proper Remedy, will have a better effect than all the
Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the World.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:42110:168"/>
               <p>The Ancients very fooliſhly applied Cupping-glaſſes on the
top of the Head, in an Inflammation of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula,</hi> and on the
<hi>Hypochondria</hi> to ſtop bleeding of the Noſe, or under the Breaſts
in Women, to ſtop the Flux of the <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> or on the midſt of
the lower Belly to draw up the Womb, and on the Region of the Kidneys to allay
Nephritick pains.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which indicate the uſe of Cupping-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are
all thoſe Diſtempers above mentioned.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of Cupping, the wet and the dry way; the
firſt is deſigned to draw the Blood; and the latter only to irritate the
Part, and rarefie the Humours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.</p>
                  <p>In order to apply Cupping-glaſſes, place the Patient in a
proper Situation according to the place on which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to fix them;
then rub the Part very well with a warm Cloth, and ſetting fire to the Tow in
the Glaſs apply it, and the fire will be preſently extinguiſhed, and the
Fleſh tumefie in that place. In ſtead of Tow, you may put a ſmall wax
Candle lighted in a little Tin Candleſtick on the part, and clap one of the
Glaſſes over this, the Candle will immediately go out, and the Fleſh
ſwelling rife up into the Glaſs, which you may leave on for as long a time
as you pleaſe. This is the way of dry Cupping.</p>
                  <p>But if you would draw Blood, make Scarifications on the Part
as deep as you judge is convenient, beginning beneath and riſing upwards,
becauſe if you begin above and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, the Blood will hinder you from
performing the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration well. The Scarifications muſt be made a croſs one
another, that ſo the skin may have no check. When this is done, you may apply
Cupping-glaſſes on the Scarifications, in the ſame manner as in the dry
way of Cupping, and the Blood will run into the Glaſs, which when it is half
full muſt be removed to empty it and another applyed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating this as
often as there is occaſion.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Scarifications, ſome Superficial,
and theſe are ſmall ſcratches which do not enter the Skin, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are
midling and extend to the Fleſh, the laſt ſort are larger and deeper, and
are ſlaſhes. The firſt are only uſeful in Diſtempers of the Skin, and
the Inciſions in Gangrenes and dangerous Diſtempers.</p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:42110:168"/>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. After dry Cupping lay on the Part a Compreſs
dipt in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> ſimple or Camphorated, and keep it on with a
Napkin folded in three pleats, and faſtned round the Breaſt if the Back be
cupt, or with a Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let if it be the Leg or Arm.</p>
                  <p>When the Part is Scarified cleanſe the Inciſion with
<hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and make a Bandage.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE of Scarifications conſiſts in applying a
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccative Emplaſter to cicatrize them.</p>

Hiſtory of a Man of forty years of Age, of a good Temper of Body, who was
ſiezed with a violent Flux of Blood at the Noſe. His Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ordered
him to keep himſelf in a hot place and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe a Cupping, which together
ſo encreaſed his Bleeding, that in a few Hours he loſt ſeveral Pints.
The Flux conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and became ſo violent, that the Blood diſcharged it
ſelf outwardly, as well as into the Stomach, and in a few Days time, the
Patient voided 27 <abbr>

ſhews us, that on a like occaſion the Patient ought never to be kept in a

               </head>
               <p>LEeches are <hi>a ſort of Water-worms, applied to a Part to
draw out Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Leeches are applied to ſuch parts as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure
Scarification; as the Face, Lips, Noſe, Fingers, Joynts, and the Fundament in
the Piles.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS that Leeches ought to be applyed, are thoſe above
mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> a neceſſity of Scarifying, and an unaptneſs in
the Part to admit of it.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>You muſt not make uſe of thoſe which are taken out of
ſtanding Waters, as Marſhes and Pits, (which moſt commonly have a large
Head, and ſhine in the Night like Glow-worms, and have their Back ſtreaked
with Blew) for theſe often are dangerous and cauſe Inflammations, Feavers
and <hi>Syncope's;</hi> Thoſe are beſt which are found in clear and
running. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are long and ſlender, have a ſmall Head, and a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
back ſtreaked with Yellow, and their Belly a little Reddiſh.</p>
                  <p>Before Leeches be applyed, let them ſtand for ſome Days in
a Veſſel of clear Water to Vomit. When Leeches are kept in a Glaſs for
uſe, the Water ought to be changed once in three Days, and for about ten or
twelve hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are applyed, let them be kept in a Box, for this
makes them more Hungry, and draw Blood with more eagerneſs.</p>
                  <p>Before you apply them, chafe the Part well with a Spunge dipt
in warm Water or Milk, and if the Leech do not ſtick to the Part, lay on a
drop or two of the Blood of ſome other Animal. Put them to the Part in the
Box it ſelf, for if you touch them with your Fingers they will be irritated,
and will not bite. When the Patient feels ſeveral Pricks take away the Box,
and if there be not enough faſtened to the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> apply it again</p>
                  <p>If the Leeches fall off before they have ſucked Blood
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, take others up in a Napkin and apply them to the <pb n="307" facs="tcp:42110:169"/>ſame Punctures which the firſt have made. When they do not draw
enough cut off the little end of their Tail, for the Blood coming away as
faſt as they ſuck it, they will never be ſatisfied and ſuck
perpetually, beſides by this means what quantity they draw may be known. When
they have drawn enough you muſt not pull them away, for then they will leave
their Sting in the Wound, but throw ſome ſharp thing or other on their
Heads, as Aſhes or the like, and then they will quit their Hold; after which
you may let a little Blood run, for this carries off any Venom that may happen
to be left in the Wound.</p>

Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Medicines, as a Compreſs dipt in ſome Styptick Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as
<hi>Aſhes of Galls,</hi> or ſome other Aſtringent Powders. However a
Compreſs and Bandage is neceſſary, and if there be an Inflammation, the
Compreſs may be dipt in <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> Camphorated; and here note,
this is ſooner made by repeated extinction of lighted Camphire, than the

Bliſters.</head>
               <p>VEſicatories are certain <hi>Applications which raiſe
ſmall Bladders or Bliſters on the Skin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Occaſion of applying Bliſters are Vertigo's,
Fluxons on the Eyes or Ears, Pains of the Teeth, Epilepſies, Apoplexies,
Soporoſe Diſtempers, the Gout, the Bites of Venomous Animals, and the
Stinging of Waſps, Bees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which indicate Bliſtering to be neceſſary, are
ſome one of thoſe immediately above recited.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Bliſters are raiſed with <hi>Cantharides</hi> or Spaniſh
Flies dryed and powder'd, and mixed with <hi>Leaven,</hi> and ſo applyed to
ſome one part of the Body. Before you apply any Viſicatory make a light
Friction of the part with a courſe Cloth to open the Pores, to make way for
the more prompt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cauſtick Salts. The Skin of a Child which is
thin and of a delicate contexture, do's not require ſo ſtrong a
Veſicatory, as that of a grown Perſon, and more or few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Veſicatories
ought to be applyed in proportion to the quantity of Seroſities you intend to
draw.</p>
                  <p>The Patient may know when a Bliſter is drawn, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he do's then feel the Pain which the Emplaſter cauſes at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Bliſters muſt not be opened till after ſome Days, when
the Fleſh begins to grow a little harder, for otherwiſe the Air entring too
ſoon, would create violent pain.</p>
                  <p>Bliſters ordinarily riſe in ſix or ſeven Hours. If you
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have a continual evacuation, leave the Bliſtring Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter on
the part, and a Seroſity will continually come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. In Pains of the Teeth
Bliſters are frequently applyed to the Neck, and kept running for a long
time.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When a Veſicatory is taken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the
Bliſters opened, apply a Compreſs dipt in ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquour, and
keep it on with ſome Bandage adapted to the Part; for inſtance, on the
Temples with a Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief <pb n="309" facs="tcp:42110:170"/>folded Triangularwiſe, on
the Trunk of the Body with the Napkin, and on the Limbs with a Roller.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If you do not deſire the evacuation for any long
time, take off the Veſicatory, waſh the Part with ſome Spirituous
Liquour, and then lay on ſome good Deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Emplaſter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> Of the <hi>Varices</hi> in the
Veins.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>a Ligature or ſtrait Bandage of a Vein,
which is dilated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The internal Cauſe of <hi>Varices</hi> is a Thick,
Grumous, Blood, coagulated by ſome Acid, which hinders the Circulation, and
neceſſarily dilates the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
               <p>Women with Child frequently have Varicoſe Swellings in their
Leggs, becauſe the Iliac Veſſels being compreſt by the <hi>Foetus,</hi>
the refluent Blood cannot paſs in a due quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through them, and
conſequently muſt regurgitate and diſtend the Veſſels in the Feet and
Legs.</p>
               <p>The SIGNS. Theſe Tumours are great ſwoln Veins, of a Violet,
Livid or Black colour, which frequently are ſeated on the Legs near the
Knees. Theſe Tumours upon the leaſt compreſſion diſappear, but
inſtantly return. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theſe Swellings are very ſerviceable to the
Patient, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if they are Hypochondriacal or Melancholy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but if the Blood ferments in them, and ſeems diſpos'd to burſt the Vein,
threatning a Malignant Ulcer by its ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the Pain be violent,
then you may make the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>The OPERATION</p>
               <p>Pinch up the Skin a croſs the Tumour, and let a Servant hold
one end; do you take the other end and make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion lengthways, till you
have laid the Veſſel bare, then take the Vein with a Hook to ſeparate it
more convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from its Membranes, and paſs a Needle threaded with a
double waxed Thread, and tie the Vein below the Dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and open the
Veſſel with a Lancet to let out the Blood. If you have no mind to make this
Operation, you may open the Vein with a Lancet to let out the Blood, as in
Bleeding, and when you think you have drawn enough make a <pb n="312" facs="tcp:42110:172"/>ſtrait Bandage, and forbear undoing it till the Swelling be down,
and the Vein reduced to its Natural Size; or when you have taken away Blood
enough, apply a Plate of Lead on it with Aſtringent Medicines, and bind this
Plate on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrictly, for by this means the Blood being hindred from
paſſing through that Vein, it will by degrees be leſſened, till it is
entirely gone.</p>
               <p>If you have no mind to open the <hi>Varix,</hi> you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a
Spunge dipt in a Decoction of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch Alum, Common Salt,</hi> and four
<hi>Pomgranates,</hi> applying it twice a day, and continuing it on for the
ſpace of a Month. When the <hi>Varix</hi> appears to be dryed away, remove
the Spunge and keep the part bound ſtrait for a Month or two, till the
Swelling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſappear.</p>
               <p>The following Medicine is good againſt all Pains and Swellings
of the <hi>Varices.</hi> ℞. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent of Populeon,</hi> Muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages of

                     </gap>. of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil, Flower
of Beans,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ℥ij. and with Wax <hi>q. ſ.</hi> make a Cerate or
Emplaſter.</p>
               <p>THE DRESSING. After the Ligature is made on the <hi>Varix,</hi>
dreſs it with ſome good Digeſtive or Balſam, that ſo the extremities
of the Veſſels may cicatrize, and then put Doſſils into the Wound, and
lay on a Pledgit arm'd with ſome good Digeſtive, and over this a
Compreſs, keeping all on with a Roller above two Inches broad, and of a
length proportioned to the Part, and rolled Spirally on it.</p>
               <p>THE CURE conſiſts in dreſſing the Wound twice a a Day,
Deterging it, and then Cicatrizing it. The Threads will rot in the Suppuration,
and then they may be drawn out.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to treat the Patient in this manner, but you
muſt farther be careful to ſweeten the Blood with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks, as a
Decoction of <hi>Guajacum, China</hi> and <hi>Sarſapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla,</hi> not
forgetting Purging and Bleeding, if the Phyſicians approve of it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> Of Reducing the Fundament.</head>
               <p>THIs Operation is the <hi>Reduction of the Gut into its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
place, when it is fallen out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The falling out of the <hi>Rectum,</hi> proceeds from
ſtraining in going to ſtool, from a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> of the Muſcular
Fibres of the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> or a Relaxation of them by a conſtant
Defluxion of Humidities, or ſome vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Cough, long Looſneſs,
Dyſentery, or the Piles, any of which are ſufficient to produce this
effect.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. This Diſeaſe is viſible enough, part of the Gut
hanging out of the <hi>Anus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be of long ſtanding, the Reduction is very difficult and
dangerous, and there being moſt commonly a large Tumour, the Gut is inflamed
and gangrenes.</p>
               <p>If it proceeds from a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> of the
<hi>Sphincter,</hi> the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is very hard to cure, and whatever pains
you take to replace it, it notwithſtanding ſoon falls out again. But when
it is recent or in young Perſons of a good Habit of Body, it may be remedied
without any great difficulty.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To reduce the Fundament, place the Patient on his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with
his Head low and his Hips raiſed, and having dipt your Fingers in <hi>Oyl of
Roſes,</hi> gently thruſt in the Roll form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the extraverſion of the
Rugous Membrane of the <hi>Rectum,</hi> or take a Compreſs dipt in Warm Milk,
and with this thruſt the Fundament up.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Foment the Part well and apply A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents to
it, keeping them on with the double T, or the Roller with four Tails
ſuſpended with a Collar. The Way of making which Bandage, is deſcribed at
large in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cutting for the Stone, and the <hi>Fiſtula in
Ano.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:42110:173"/>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient lie on his Belly for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Days
together, that ſo the Gut may have time to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its Strength, and rub the
Part well with <hi>Oyl of Beetles.</hi> This Oyl is made by the infuſion of a
good quantity of <hi>Beetles</hi> in <hi>Oyl of Turpentine,</hi> expoſed to
the Sun for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time. <hi>Oyl of Turpentine</hi> alone is
ſufficient for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>If the Belly be bound give Clyſters frequently, or let the
Patient take an Ounce of <hi>Oyl of ſweet Almonds</hi> with a dram of
<hi>Cream of Tartar.</hi> If the Pain be very troubleſome, foment the part
with a Decoction of <hi>Cowſlip</hi> and <hi>Camomile</hi> Flowers in Milk.
Fumigations of <hi>Frankincenſe</hi> and <hi>Maſtick</hi> are good; In
ſhort, to prevent the Fundament from falling out again, uſe all ſorts of
Aſtringent Remedies.</p>

                     <hi>Fab. Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 76. tells us,
that a certain Countrey-Man going to ſtool, the <hi>Rectum</hi> fell out, and
it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vehement cold Weather, he was ſeized with ſo ſharp a Pain, that
he was forced to remain in the place, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſtir. The Gut grew as
big as an Egg, and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which were very liquid, came away
perpetually. <hi>Hildanus</hi> being called to him, treated him in this manner.
In the firſt place he applied this Cataplaſm to the <hi>Anus.</hi> R.
<hi>Leaves and Flowes of</hi> Tapſus Barbatus, <hi>Flowers of Melilot and
Camomile, Roots and Leaves of Mallows,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. one Handful, <hi>Seeds of
Linſeed and Fenugreek,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ℥ſs. <hi>Aniſe-ſeeds,</hi>
℥i. Boil the Ingredients in Cows Milk, and apply Stuphes wrung out of it,
continuing them on for the ſpace of an hour; then he ſtrew'd a little of
the following Powder on the Gut. ℞. <hi>Red Roſes, Pomgranat Peels,
Cypreſs Nuts, Maſtich, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> Crocus Martis, <hi>Calx of
Lead,</hi> Mix equal parts of theſe, and make a Powder. Then hanging the
Patient up by the Heels, and having wrapt his Finger in a very fine Rag dipt in
the Decoction, he put it into the Gut, and gently thruſt it into its Natural
Place. Then he anointed the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> and the Rump-Bone with a
Liniment made of <hi>Oyl of Roſes</hi> and <hi>Worms,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ℥i.
<hi>Oyl of Roſe-buds,</hi> ℥ſs. mixt all together. In the laſt

with <hi>Rhubarb, Agarick and Senna,</hi> having firſt bled him in the

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> Of Reducing the Womb when it is fallen
out.</head>
               <p>THis Operation is the <hi>Reſtoring the Neck of the Womb to
its Natural place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Relaxation of the Neck of the Womb after
Delivery, ſometimes proceeds from the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of the Mid-wife in
drawing too violently its <hi>Rugae,</hi> and tearing it from the Parts to
which it adheres, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ariſes from the Natural Laxity of the
Part.</p>
               <p>The abundance of Humidities which flow hither, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cauſe this falling out of the Womb, as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but improperly,
called, ſince it never is the Body of the Womb which comes forth, but the
<hi>Vagina</hi> only.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The falling out or Relaxation of the
<hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina,</hi> may be perceived without any great Difficulty; there appears
a Thick, Hard, Round Subſtance not unlike a Gut, which hangs between a Womans
Legs, and has a Roll at bottom with a Hole in the midſt, which is commonly
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken for the inner Orifice of the Womb.</p>
               <p>A ſimple Relaxation of the Neck of the Womb is not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
if there be no Inflammation, Ulcer, or Gangrene. When the Diſeaſe is
recent, there is no great Difficulty in curing it, but if it be of long
ſtanding, it is incurable. If it proceed from an internal Cauſe, and the
Relaxation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by degrees, the Diſtemper is curable; but if the
fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of the Womb proceed from ſome external Cauſe, as the
ſtraining of a Woman in Labour, or the Mid-wifes forcibly drawing out the
<hi>Rugae,</hi> there is but little probability of Succeſs.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>For the reſtoring the <hi>Vagina</hi> to its proper place,
let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lie on her Back with her Hipps raiſed, and the Artiſt
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt Humected his Fingers with <hi>Oyl of Roſes,</hi> may then
gently thruſt it into its Natural place. If the <hi>Vagina</hi> be very much
tumefied and cannot re-enter, he muſt by no means handle it roughly, for fear
of an Inflammation or Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene; but he muſt humect and foment it with
Emollient <pb n="316" facs="tcp:42110:174"/>Decoctions, and forbear reducing it till the
Swelling be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed. If there be a Mortification already on the
<hi>Vagina,</hi> it muſt be ſpeedily cut off, which is the only means he
can have recourſe to ſave the Patients Life. For the doing this, let him
make a Ligature on the Sound part, and cut off that which is corrupted; and if
there be a <hi>Cancer</hi> draw the <hi>Vagina</hi> to him, and extirpate that
by the Roots, ſtopping the Blood with good Stypticks.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING conſiſts in introducing a Peſſary into
the Neck of the Womb, which is to be done in this manner. Take a good thick bit
of Cork, and cut it into the ſhape of a Cylinder of two Inches or more in
Diameter, in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the largeneſs of the <hi>Vagina.</hi> This muſt
not be round, but five or ſix cornered, or of any other Multangular Figure
for the better retaining it, and muſt have a Hole in the midſt to give
Paſſage to the <hi>Menſes:</hi> This Peſſary muſt be dipt in white
Wax to prevent it from rotting, and likewiſe from hurting the ſides by its
inequalities; and muſt be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as far as is poſſible into the Neck
of the Womb to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and be kept in till the Perſon be cured, or all
her Lifetime if there be a neceſſity for it.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. For reſtoring the Tone of the <hi>Vagina,</hi>
make a Fumigation with the Skin of an <hi>Eell,</hi> or <hi>Maſtich</hi> and
<hi>Olibanum.</hi> Fomentations with <hi>Spirit of Feverfew Camphora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
cure obſtructions of the Womb, and dry up the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, or a
Peſſary may be put up into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> as was above directed. If
any Fleſhy Excreſcences grow in the Neck of the Womb, cut them off. If
there be any Venereal Ulcers, dry them up with <hi>Lime-Water</hi> mixt with
<hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> or ℞. <hi>Spirit of Wine Camphorated,</hi>
℥iv. <hi>Olibanum</hi> in <hi>Powder,</hi> ℥i. Saccharum Saturni,
<g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>Burnt Alum,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all theſe together,

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence hanging out of the Lips of her Privities, every one thought it

                  <p>The following Hiſtory made a mighty noiſe ſome time

This falling out of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> gradually encreaſed from her
Childhood, ſhe was ſearched by the Phyſicians of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> who
gave their Opinion, that this falling out of the Womb was a Real Yard, and upon
this Determination, the Magiſtrates of the Town ordered her to go in Mans
Habit. In this Equipage ſhe came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe got Money by
ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf, till upon aſſurance that ſhe was a Woman, and a

               <p>THis is <hi>an Inciſion made into an Abſceſs, to let out
the</hi> Pus <hi>contained in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of Abſceſſes is ſome groſs Humour, which
being brought into a Part by the Circulation of the Blood, and being not able
to paſs through the narrow Channels is congeſted there. This Feculent
Matter is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a crude, viſcous Chyle, coagulated by Cold, or ſome
acid or aſtringent Applications, or a thouſand like Accidents.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which diſcover an Abſceſs, are a great Pain,
Inflammation, and Pulſation of the Part, and a Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which gradually
encreaſes to its height; but when the Suppuration is compleated, the
Pulſation and Pain ceaſe, the Tumour grows ſofter than at firſt, and
becomes white in ſome places.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>The Tumour muſt be opened with a Lancet, or ſome
Cauſtick.</p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:42110:175"/>
                  <p>If you would make the Operation with a Lancet, chuſe the
thinneſt and moſt depending part, to avoid putting the Patient to more pain
than need, and giving the <hi>Pus</hi> a free diſcharge. The Orifice muſt
be too large rather than too ſmall, for the more convenient applying of
Medicines and evacuating the <hi>Pus,</hi> which ſometimes is Grumous and
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted.</p>
                  <p>When the Abſceſs is very large, you muſt not empty it at
once, for fear the Patient fall into a <hi>Syncope,</hi> nor ſqueeze it to
expreſs the Matter, for fear of making a contuſion of the tender
Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>If the Skin which covers it be thick, as for inſtance in the
Heel, pare it for making an Inciſion more conveniently and eaſily.</p>
                  <p>In opening an Abſceſs, hold the Lancet between the
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Fore-finger and Thumb, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in
bleeding; but if it be large and the Skin be thick, as in the Thighs and
Buttocks, hold it between the Thumb and the middle Finger, that ſo you may
employ more force in the uſing it.</p>
                  <p>If the Patient be timorous, you may open the Abſceſs with
a Cauſtick in the manner above directed, and this is done with leſs Pain.
If you endeavour to break the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by Topical applications, as the <hi>Dung
of Animals,</hi> or Humane Excrements, which are beſt of all, let them be
applied as hot as the Patient can endure them, and be kept on the Part with a
Compreſs and Bandage. But obſerve here, it is by no means adviſeable to
wait till ſome ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings break of themſelves; for inſtance, ſuch as
are in the Breaſt, Belly, or Fundament, or near any Bones, Tendons, or other
Nervous parts, becauſe the long detention of the <hi>Pus</hi> in thoſe
parts is apt to rot them, or leave <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> behind it. The ſame
caution is to be us'd in Venereal Bubo's, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pocky Venom if it be
not ſoon diſcharged, is apt to infect the Maſs of Blood, and ſo in
<hi>Paronychias</hi> for fear the <hi>Pus</hi> rot the Tendons of the Finger if
it be kept in too long.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIX.</hi> Of the <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> or
Dropſie of the Head.</head>
               <p>THis Operation is <hi>an Inciſion made in the Head, to let out
the Waters lodg'd in that Part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. An <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> is a Watry Tumour on the
Head.</p>
               <p>This Diſtemper moſt commonly proceeds from an Extravaſated
<hi>Lympha,</hi> occaſioned by ſome Blow, Fall, Wound or Compreſſion of
the Veſſels. This Water is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in different places, as <hi>v.
g.</hi> between the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> and the Teguments, between the
<hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> between the Membranes of the Brain,
or in its Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. When the Water is between the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi>
and the Skull, the Swelling feels ſoft; if it be lodg'd between the Skull and
<hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or in the Subſtance of the Brain, there is a great Pain
in the Head attended with <pb n="320" facs="tcp:42110:176"/>a <hi>Coma,</hi> the Head is
large and heavy, and in Children it is Swoln, their Forehead is prominent, and
their Eyes run with Water.</p>
               <p>Children moſt commonly die of this Diſtemper, and if the
largeneſs of their Heads encreaſe it is an ill ſign; if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be
lodged in the Ventricles of the Brain, there is no cure to be hoped for.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> be accompanied with an Apoplexy or
Lethargy, Death is not far off. If the Patient void Blood at the Noſe, it is
a ſign the <hi>Lympha</hi> is very Acrimonious and Pungent. This Diſtemper
is Chronical, and frequently Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Patient.</p>
               <p>If the Water be lodg'd between the Teguments and the Skull, the
Diſtemper is curable; but if it be beneath the Skull there is no great Hopes;
however if the cure be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, it muſt be done in the following
manner.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Make an Inciſion through the Teguments with a Lancet, and
let the Orifice be large enough, becauſe the Water moſt commonly is thick
and foul, and let it in the next place be made in the loweſt part to
diſcharge the Swelling, which muſt be done at diverſe times, and not at
once, for fear the Patient fall into a <hi>Syncope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Water is beneath the Skull, apply the Trepan, and if
it be under the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> pierce that with a Lancet.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING is the ſame as in the Trepan, and is
deſcribed in the Chapter concerning that Operation, where the Reader if he
pleaſe to take the pains may find it.</p>
                  <p>If the Water be only under the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> the
putting a <hi>Cannula</hi> into the Inciſion is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Confine the Patient to a regular Diet, let all his
Food be drying, as roaſted Fowls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let him drink good
Wine. Let his Exerciſe and Sleep be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and let him frequently take
Purgative, Diuretick, Diaphoretick, and Cephalick Medicines.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Purgatives in this caſe are Hydragogues, as
<hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Jalap,</hi>

                  <p>Some years ſince there was a Girl of ten years of Age
ſhewn at St <hi>Germains</hi> Fair, whoſe Head was two foot and three
inches in Circumference. This Deformity began to appear ſome time after her
Birth, and ſhe was ſo ſtupified with it, that ſhe could neither Speak
nor Walk, only ſome times ſhe would cry like a little Child; her Skin
adhered to her Bones, and her Leggs were crooked, ſhe lived upon Milk and
Spoon-Meat, and the Bones of her Head were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, eſpecially in the
place of the Fontanel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kerkringius</hi> aſſures us, that in opening a Child
of three Months and a half old, who died of an <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> he found
nothing beſides a thick ſaline <hi>Serum</hi> in the Brain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tulpius</hi> tells us, he had taken five Dutch pints of
Water out of the Head of a Child, and its Brain had loſt its round
Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kerkringius</hi> aſſures us, he had found a Brain in a
young Lad of fourteen years of Age, without any Conſiſtence. This Lad in
his Life-time, had been very ſtupid and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, there was a diſtance
between the <hi>Pia-Mater</hi> and the Brain, and another between the Brain and
the <hi>Cerebel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Miſcellanea Curioſa,</hi> there is a Relation
of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king 30 Ounces of clear Saline Water out of the Head of a Child of
one year old. At firſt thoſe who diſſected him did imagine there was no
Brain, becauſe it had loſt its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous Figure, and the <hi>Medulla
Oblongata</hi> adhered to the Arch of the Bone. In proſecuting the
Diſſection, there was no Fat beneath the Skin, which always is found there
in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There was a great quantity of Water in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> like
that in the Head. The Kidneys were of a very unequal bigneſs, the Pituitary
and Pineal Glands in the Brain were wanting, and in its <hi>Baſis</hi> there
were ſeveral Nervous Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were judged to belong to the eighth
pair, and were beſmeared with a thick Mucilage.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XL.</hi> Of Opening parts imperforate.</head>
               <p>THis Operation is <hi>making an Orifice with an Inſtrument, in
parts where the Natural ones are deficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Occaſion is a deficiency in Nature, when
Children are born with their Ears, Noſe, Mouth, Privities, Yard or Fundament
cloſed with a Membrane (which is a continuation of the Skin) or ſome
Fungous or Schirrhous Excreſcence.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Theſe defects are viſible upon inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and
the Child which is ſo imperforate, cannot breath through its Mouth or Noſe,
or void its Excrements by its Fundament.</p>
               <p>If the Auditory paſſage be ſtopt by a Thick Membrane, the
Child will remain deaf all its Life-time, unleſs this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment be early
removed. If the <hi>Rectum</hi> in Girls open into the Privities, this is
incurable, and the Excrements will be voided that way.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Foetus</hi> naturally has a Membrane which covers the
Drum of the Ear, and if this Membrane be very thick, and Nature of its own
accord do's not reſolve it, you muſt pierce it with a Lancet, otherwiſe
the party will be deprived of Hearing.</p>
                  <p>If the paſſage be ſtopt by an Excreſcence, cut it off
with a pair of Sciſſars, or make a Ligature with a Thread, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it
by degrees; but the Sciſſars are beſt, becauſe the Ligature is ſome
time before it takes it off. Sometimes this Fungous or Schirrous Subſtance
poſſeſſes all the Duct, and then no Sciſſars can reach it; in this
caſe you muſt have recourſe to Cauſticks, to conſume the remaining
Carnoſity. When you uſe theſe, you muſt be very careful to prevent them
from hurting the Drum of the Ear, for if they ſhould touch this, they would
not fail to corrode it through, and the Party loſe his Hearing for ever; to
prevent which Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, I think it would be convenient to faſten them to
the end of your Probe, that ſo you may draw them out at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:42110:177"/>
                  <p>When the Childs Noſtrils are cloſed by a Membrane, it
muſt be cut in the midſt lengthways. Sometimes Childrens Noſtrils adhere
together after the Small Pox, in which caſe they may be ſeparated with a
<hi>Spatula;</hi> but if they adhere too firmly, or are ſtopt by ſome
Carnoſity, the Lancet muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> is cloſed by a Membrane,
which hinders the Child from making Water. In this caſe an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt
be made with a ſtrong Lancet directly down, for fear of Wounding the
<hi>Glans.</hi> If the <hi>Glans</hi> happen to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at its extremity,
and perforated under the <hi>Penis</hi> in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> open its
extremity with a Lancet, and introduce a Leaden pipe to paſs through, and
Scarifie the preternatural Aperture, and Cicatrize it, and then bind up the
Yard with a Narrow Fillet, leaving the Child to piſs through the Pipe.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> were ſtopt through its whole
length, you might pierce it with a Bodkin, and then put a Leaden Pipe in till
the Duct were cloſed, for without this the ſides would grow together, and
the paſſage be ſtopt as before.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Anus</hi> be cloſed by a Membrane. you may make
an Inciſion lengthways with a Lancet, but if it be ſtopt by a Carnous
Excreſcence, you muſt pierce the Fleſh till the <hi>Meconium</hi> appear,
but this is dangerous, and very often the Child dies in the Operation.</p>
                  <p>If only the Entry of the <hi>Vagina</hi> be cloſed by a
Membrane, you may divide it with a Lancet; but if the ſides of the
<hi>Vagina</hi> adhere together, you muſt place the Patient on her Back with
her Knees rais'd, and her Thighs ſpread, and ſo make an Inciſion with a
crooked Knife, beginning above and ending below, with the back of the
Inſtrument turned toward the <hi>Nymphae,</hi> and in this manner you may
proceed to cut till the <hi>Vagina</hi> be opened.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING conſiſts in introducing Tents armed with good
Digeſtives into the Wound, if there be any Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous or Carnous
Excreſcences, which may require a Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to conſume them. If there be
no neceſſity of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Digeſtion, introduce <hi>Cannula's</hi> or
Pipes of Lead proportioned to the largeneſs of the Inciſion, to hinder the
parts from adhering together; and for the making theſe Pipes more eaſie,
let them be well ſmeared with <hi>Oyl of Roſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE CURE. When there is a neceſſity of making a large
Wound, as there is in caſes of Excreſcences and <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus's,</hi> 
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:42110:178"/>let the Patient be prepared by bleeding, Clyſters, and

               <p>THE CAUSE of cutting it, is the Inconvenience which ariſes
from its length, as that the Child can never ſpeak plain, becauſe the
Tongue has not liberty to ſtrike againſt the Roof of the Mouth, for the
forming Articulate Sounds.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The length of the <hi>Fraenum</hi> is viſible
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, it appearing continued to the tip of the Tongue. This Inconvenience is
not in any manner dangerous, but when it is cut with the Nail as Midwifes

                  <p>Hold down the Childs lower Jaw, and lift up the Tongue with a
Fork, which muſt be round and blunt at the point, and cut the Ligament (as
near the Tongue as poſſible) quite to the Roots, taking care not to divide
the large Veſſels, for fear of a troubleſome Haemorrhage.</p>
                  <p>The Surgeon if he pleaſe may do this more dexterouſly with
his Fingers, without uſing the Fork at all. For this purpoſe, let him
depreſs the lower Jaw with the Thumb of his left Hand, and preſs the Tongue

which may happen to be lodg'd in ſome part or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Humane
Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE is that Extraneous Subſtance which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the Perſon.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Whilſt any ſuch Body remains lodg'd in any part,
there is moſt commonly a perpetual Pain.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If a Bullet be lodged in the Part, you muſt endeavour to
extract it upon the firſt Dreſſing, for fear leaſt when the
Inflammation increaſes it be pent up.</p>
                  <p>For the better extracting the Bullet, place the Patient in the
ſame poſture that he was in at the time he received the Wound, and then
dilate if it be neceſſary, and ſeek for the Ball with the Probe, and when
you have found it, extract it with the <hi>Forceps,</hi> Extracter,
<hi>Terebellum,</hi> Ducks, Cranes, or Ravens Bill.</p>
                  <p>If a Buller or any other extraneous Body whatever enter the
Fleſh ſo far, that it cannot be conveniently brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42110:180"/>ſearch on the oppoſite ſide with the Finger, and
when you perceive where it is lodged by its hardneſs, make an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on
it avoiding the Veſſels, and fetch it away through the Orifice. When it
enters the Bone, ſtir it gently for fear of breaking off ſome Splinter.
When the extraneous Body cannot be drawn out without Violence, you may wait for
the Digeſtion which frequently throws it out.</p>
                  <p>If a Pea, Cherry-Stone, or any the like ſmall Body fall into
the Ear, let the Patient lie on his ſound Ear, and bring it away with a
ſmall <hi>Forceps,</hi> but if it be ſo large as to fill the Cavity of the
Ear, and you cannot apprehend it, introduce a Probe with ſome Glutinous
Matter at the end, that ſo it may ſtick to it, and come away. If ſome
inſect creep into the Ear, kill it by pouring hot Oyl in.</p>
                  <p>If Sand, Duſt, or any ſuch like Body fall into the Eye,
lift up the Eye-lid and put under it one of thoſe Stones found in the Head of
Crabs, and called Crabs Eyes, and by ſome means or other oblige the Patient
to ſleep, for ſo this will not come away till it has cleared the Eye, this
way is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by <hi>Fab. Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>If any Splinter of Wood hurt the Eye, lift up the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids and
take it away with a ſmall <hi>Forceps,</hi> or a piece of Rag rolled up and
wetted at one end with the Patients Spittle, or a little Lint, or a bit of a
Spunge dipt in <hi>Roſe</hi> or <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Water</hi> at the end of a
Probe. If it be Duſt fetch it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a <hi>Collyrium,</hi> or if it be a
Scale of Iron, apply the Loadſtone.</p>
                  <p>If a Body be lodg'd in the Noſe extract it with a
<hi>Forceps,</hi> or cauſe the Patient to ſneeze with Powder of
<hi>Tobacco, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore,</hi> or any other good Sternutatory; or if theſe do
not bring it away, you may let it alone, and it will fall into the Patients
Mouth of its own accord.</p>
                  <p>If any Body be ſtopt in the Throat, as for inſtance a
Bone, give the Perſon ſeven or eight Grains of <hi>Gummi Gotta,</hi> or if
the Accident be very preſſing, the ſame quantity of <hi>Emetick
Tartar</hi> in ſome liquid Vehicle, If theſe are not ſufficient to bring
away this Extraneous Body, open the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Mouth, Depreſs his Tongue with
a <hi>Speculum Oris,</hi> and bring away the unnatural Body with a
<hi>Forceps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Body be ſo far down in the Throat, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
apprehend it with a <hi>Forceps,</hi> take a piece of Spunge as big as a
ſmall Nut, and faſtning it with a Thread, let the Patient ſwallow it, and
then draw it back, and by this means you may often bring up any Extraneous Body
lodged in <pb n="329" facs="tcp:42110:180"/>the Throat, or you may thruſt it down with a
Wax Candle.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Apply Compreſſes dipt in ſome
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent and Reſolvent Liquour to prevent any Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or uſe
Gargariſms of the ſame virtue.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If the Extraneous Body has made any Wound, or
Inflamed the Throat, let the Patient abſtain from all ſolid Food, for fear
leaſt the Aliments encreaſe the Inflammation by fretting the Parts in their
Deſcent into the Stomach, and let him feed on good Broths, and take cooling
Clyſters, having Recourſe to bleeding, if the Inflammation be very
conſiderable.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLIV.</hi> Of the Extirpation of Scrophulous
Tumours.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Exciſion or Conſuming of
Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous Glands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. When the Glands of the Neck are large or tumefied,
they are ſaid to be Scrophulous. This Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ariſes from an
acid <hi>Lympha</hi> which obſtructs the Glands, and coagulates the Matter
contained in them. A ſedentary unactive Life, is often the occaſion of
Scrophulous Tumours; for the Motion of the Blood being very ſlow, and not
driving the Matter through the Part, it ſtagnates and breeds theſe Strumous
Swellings, and for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a thick, foggy Air, External Cold, and
all Viſcous Meats have the ſame effect. Waters which flow down from the
Mountains, are apt to breed theſe Diſtempers, becauſe their Chillneſs
very much abates the rapid Motion of the Blood and thickens the
<hi>Lympha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strumae</hi> which are of a Cancerous Nature are very
difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, eſpecially if they are of long ſtanding, by reaſon
there <pb n="330" facs="tcp:42110:181"/>is a great proportion of an Acid in them; but
ſuch as are ſoft and pendulous, are not altogether ſo obſtinate at
firſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bronchocele</hi> muſt not be confounded with
Scrophulous Swellings, for this is peculiar to the Neck and Throat, and is of a
prodigious ſize ſometimes hanging down like a ſack, and if you compreſs
it, you may perceive the <hi>Lympha</hi> fluctuate. Theſe ſwellings are
contained in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> in which the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> is congealed,
and becomes of a conſiſtence like Plaſter. This Diſtemper creates a
Difficulty of ſwallowing; the Senſes of Hearing, Taſting, and Smelling
are impaired, which poſſibly may be cauſed by Tumours compreſſing the
Nerves, and hindring the Circulation of the Spirits, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from abundance
of ſuperfluous Moiſture, which makes an inundation on the Tongue, Noſe
and Auditory paſſage, and diſables them from duely diſcerning the
qualities of the Objects preſented to them.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Strumous Tumours are evident enough of themſelves.
In feeling the Neck one may perceive ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hard and unequal ſwellings,
which are only tumefied Glands. Theſe ſwellings are ſometimes very
numerous and extend to the ſhoulders, and when this is ſo, they are not
inflamed at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strumae</hi> in the Neck ſometimes appear outwardly and
are pendulous, at other times they are implicated in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts,
hinder Reſpiration, and compreſs the <hi>Larynx.</hi> The true
<hi>Strumae</hi> are Hard, White and Indolent, and thoſe which are Livid and
Painful are Spurious.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When the <hi>Strumae</hi> are pendulous tie them with a Thread
with a ſlip knot that ſo you may ſtraiten the Ligature eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day by
little and little, and ſo the Tumour being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of its Nouriſhment,
may wither and fall away.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Strumae</hi> are not Pendulous this way cannot be
pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; and therefore in caſes of this Nature, an Inciſion muſt be
made through the skin to lay the Gland bare, and then you muſt extirpate it
together with the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> in which it is contained, and in doing
this, you muſt be careful to diſſect the part, and to ſeparate the
<hi>Cyſtis</hi> from the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies, without hurting the Nerves or
Blood-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Put Doſſils and Pledgits armed with good
Digeſtives into the Wound to procure a good Suppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42110:181"/>of the <hi>Lympha</hi> congeſted there, and then
Deterge and Cicatrize it. The Dreſſings muſt be kept on the part with a
Handkerchief folded Triangularwiſe.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. When you do not intend to proceed to the Extirpation
of a Strumous Tumour, you muſt endeavour to ſoften and reſolve it by the
moſt potent Diſcutients; for inſtance, <hi>Ammoniacum,</hi> and the
reſt of the Gumms diſſolved in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> reduced to the
conſiſtence of an Emplaſter, and ſo applied to the part, or you may
foment it with a ſpunge ſoakt in <hi>Lime Water.</hi> Cataplaſms of the
Leaves and Roots of Wild <hi>Cowcumbers</hi> beat up with <hi>Goats Dung,</hi>
is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Running <hi>Mercury</hi> applied to the Part affected, is a
potent Diſcutient, but before it can be applied, it muſt be made into a
Liniment with ſome Greaſes, <hi>Turpentine,</hi> or ſome of the Gumms. Or
℞. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. Martiatum,</hi> ℥i. <hi>Oyl of Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils and
Bays,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ℥ſs. crude <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> killed with Flower of
<hi>Brimſtone,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. Mix theſe and make an Unguent. All Mercurial
Medicines are apt to raiſe a Salivation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you uſe them,
you muſt frequently inſpect the Patients Mouth to ſee if the Tongue,
Tonſils, Gumms, or any other part begin to ſwell; for if ſo, it is a
ſign that a Salivation is ready to riſe, and then it is high time to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all the Applications, and purge with Hydragogues. The ſame Method is
to be taken if it be already begun, and you judge it convenient to prevent it,
for often times a Salivation is of very great ſervice in Scrophulous
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>
                  <p>You muſt never open Strumous Tumours till the Matter or
<hi>Lympha</hi> whence they ariſe is converted into a <hi>Pus.</hi> And if
none of the preceding Remedies ſoften or diſſipate them, you may try to
bring them to ſuppuration, by an <hi>Emplaſter</hi> of <hi>Melilot</hi>
malaxed with <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>ſweet Almonds</hi> and <hi>Serpents
Fat,</hi> or a Cataplaſm of the Roots of <hi>Marſh-mallows, White Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
Hemlock,</hi> and <hi>Wild Cowcumbers,</hi> with <hi>Oyl of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt not open the Tumour as ſoon as the Suppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is compleated, but leave the Abſceſs for ſome time, for the better
rotting and waſting the vitiated Glands. For the conſuming what remains
after the opening of the Abſceſs, put into the Wound a Digeſtive compos'd
of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> the <hi>Yelks of Eggs</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> which
will be better ſtill if a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Praecipitate</hi> be mixed with it. In
the laſt place, deterge and heal the Wound with Balſam of
<hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:42110:182"/>
                  <p>In the mean time you muſt not forget internal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.
This Powder is very good, ℞. <hi>Sea Spunge burnt,</hi> ℥iij. Os
Sepiae, <hi>Jaws of a Pike, Crabs Eyes, long Pepper. White Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Galls, Sea

uſe a Ptiſan made of the Roots of <hi>Figg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Filipendula,</hi> Leaves
of <hi>Butchers Broom,</hi> and <hi>Broom</hi> for his ordinary Drink. Powder
of Humane Skulls taken in any liquid Vehicle, is a ſpecifick in Strumous
Swellings of the Neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But obſerve that the Skull muſt neither have
been buried nor rotten, becauſe then it has loſt all its volatile

Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences.</head>
               <p>THis Operation is <hi>an Amputation, Eroſion or
Diſcuſſing of Excreſcences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. When the ſmall Nervous Filaments (by the
<hi>Rete</hi> of which the skin is formed) corroded thro', or by any Accident
divided the Nutritious Juyce which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtills from their extremities is
congeſted, and being coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the external Cold or ſome Acids, forms
Warts. If theſe Warts are on the Toes, and the ſhooe preſſes the Part
being compacted together they become of a Carnous Subſtance, and are rooted
in the Tendons, and ſpringing from them like <hi>Ganglions.</hi> When theſe
Excreſcences thruſt very far out and hard, they are termed Horns, and
moſt commonly proceed from Bones, ſeeming to be only a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation of
them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a ſoft Tumour riſes on the Joynts which
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes inſenſibly. When this has pierced the skin, it grows 
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42110:182"/>to a prodigious ſize in a very ſmall time, and is
called a Wen. This Fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y,
Soft, Pale and Indolent Subſtance, is formed by the Dilaration or Laceration
of the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, Tendon, or other Nervous part, which happens to be
hurt by ſome Fall, Contuſion, Luxation or Strain. This is almoſt always
on the Joynt, and adheres to ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes or Tendons. It proceeds from a
Mixture of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juyce, and the Mucilage of the Joynts, and by means
of the Acids in it acquires a Cancerous Malignity. Theſe <hi>Fungus's</hi>
ſometimes grow on the Membranes of the Brain.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Theſe Tumours are viſible of themſelves, Warts
are ſmall uneven Tumours, rough like Shagreen; theſe grow deep into the
skin, ſome have a large Baſis and ſharpen to a point in a Pyramidal
Figure. Theſe little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated Bodies which grow on the Feet are harder than
Warts, and reſemble a Horn being Tranſparent. Theſe differ from Corns in
no other reſpect, but that they are larger. <hi>Fungus's</hi> are ſoft,
ſpungy, whitiſh, and grow ſuddenly, they are almoſt without ſenſe,
and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ariſe about the Joynts, and on the Membranes of the
Brain.</p>
               <p>Warts are not in any manner dangerous, except when they proceed
from ſome Venereal Acid. Theſe ſmall Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are ſometimes cured by
ſlipping them off, if they do not enter the skin very deep. Warts which are
uneven and like Shagreen, are very apt to return after they are cut off,
becauſe moſt commonly they are rooted in the Tendon. Pocky Warts are more
difficult to cure than any other. Wenns continue ſometimes for ſeveral
years.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Warts muſt be cut off even with the Skin, and rubbed well
with <hi>Oyl of Tartar per deliquium.</hi> Some burn them with a Needle made
red hot in the Flame of a Candle: But the better way is to make a Ligature to
intercept the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juyce, for then they ſoon dry and fall off.</p>
                  <p>As for Corns, the beſt way is to cut them to the Root, and
when they grow again, as they will not fail to do, cut them a new. They muſt
likewiſe be cut before Cauſticks are applied to eat out the Roots, except
they grow upon a Tendon, and in this caſe you muſt forbear for fear of an
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation or Gangrene of the Part.</p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:42110:183"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fungus's</hi> and Wenns may be taken off together with
their Root if it appear, but if it do's not, you may conſume them with gentle
Cauſticks; for if they were too ſtrong, the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> would be apt
to degenerate into a <hi>Cancer.</hi> Or if you would take it off without
Exciſion, you may make a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about it, tying it every day ſtraiter to
intercept the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment which feeds it, and then apply Deſiccative
Powders to ſtop the Orifice.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING is the ſame uſed in the applying other
Cauſticks.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Theſe Tumours require both internal and external
Medicines, to prevent the Efflux and Concretion of the Nutricious Juyce. The
means to obtain this, is by blunting the Points of the Acids by Alcalies and
Sudorificks, as <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony from</hi> ℈i. <hi>to</hi>
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>Powder</hi> and <hi>Salt of Vipers</hi> in like Doſe taken in
a Glaſs of <hi>Carduus Water.</hi> Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans made of the Sudorifick Roots
are excellent. Purging with Hydragogues is very uſeful to carry off the Acid
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſities. Of this kind, are <hi>Jalap</hi> and <hi>Scammony,</hi> or their
<hi>Reſins</hi> taken from eight to fifteen Grains in <hi>Conſerve of
Roſes,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Liquid Vehicle.</p>
                  <p>The principal, external Medicines which are good againſt
Warts, are the freſh <hi>Juyce of Celandine,</hi> which muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and continued on for ſome time, having firſt made a Superficial Inciſion,
that ſo the Juyce may penetrate the better. A Solution of <hi>Sal
Armoniack,</hi> or a Liniment of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> with a little
<hi>Vitriol,</hi> or a drop or two of flaming <hi>Brimſtone</hi> from a Pins
Head, or <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Vinegar</hi> is good to
cure Corns if the Corn be firſt cut, for otherwiſe its thickneſs would be
apt to hinder the Medicine from reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deep enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> and Butter of <hi>Antimony</hi> may be
dropt from the point of a Pin, and repeated frequently, ceaſing it any
Inflammation ariſe. If Corns take Root in the Tendons, you muſt not corrode

That a certain young Lady had a prodigious Wart between the firſt and
ſecond Bones of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> of the Right Hand, which was a great
Blemiſh, but he cured her in this manner; firſt he purged the Patient, and
after this he made a Ligature <pb n="335" facs="tcp:42110:183"/>on the ſwelling with a
Thread dipt in Arſenical Water, this he continued to tie ſtraiter and
ſtraiter from time to time, till the Warts fell off, and then deterged the
Wound with <hi>

to be too forward to imitate his Practice in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, for fear of bad
Accidents happening from the uſe of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenick, as did in this young Lady,
to remedy which he purged her, bled her, laid on Defenſatives, and gave her

               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Extirpating</hi> Cyſtis's,
<hi>together with the Matter contained in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. <hi>Cyſtis's</hi> are formed out of Membranes torn
from the adjacent parts and diſtended, which like a Bag receive the
Nutricious Juyce tranſuding through the part.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which demonſtrate the exiſtence of a
<hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis</hi> filled with a Gypſeous or Steatomatous Matter, are
principally the ſituation about the Head and Neck.</p>
               <p>Theſe Swellings are without the leaſt Danger, but are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the ſwelling be large and have a broad <hi>Baſis,</hi>
make a Crucial Inciſion on the Skin, and free the Bag from its adherences to
the Neighbouring parts, either by the haft of the Knife, or diſſect it with
the point, and take it out whole with the Matter contained in it.</p>
                  <p>Some Practitioners open theſe Bags with Cauſticks, and
after Digeſtion conſume the reſt with another Cauſtick; but Extirpation
is better if the Patient will ſubmit to it.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Tumours have a ſlender <hi>Baſis,</hi> you may
take them off with a Ligature, or cut them off when they are dry and
withered.</p>

                  <p>THE DRESSING. For the conſuming the remainder of the Bag in
Suppuration, put into the Wound Doſſils and Pledgits arm'd with good
Digeſtives, ſuch as <hi>Turpentine</hi> and the <hi>Yelks of Eggs,</hi>
then cover it with an Emplaſter, and keep all on with a convenient
Bandage.</p>
                  <p>If part of the Bag remain in the ſwelling, conſume it with
Cauſticks, and if there be an Haemorrhage, ſtop the Flux with Powders or
Styptick Waters.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE conſiſts in continuing to digeſt the
ſwelling, till the remaining Bag be conſumed, and there be a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Suppuration, and then Deterging and Cicatrizing; during which purge the
Patient, and then give him Sudorificks.</p>
                  <p>Ganglions on Tendons and other Membranous parts, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
are cured by rubbing them ſtrongly with the Thumb, and ſo making a ſtrait

               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>an Amputation of part of the Toe Nail
which enters the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. This inconvenience proceeds from a want of Care in
cutting the Nail, which being preſt by the ſhooe, is bent in and thruſt
into the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The Fleſh growing over the Nail is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
there is a great Pain and Inflammation of the Toe, which ſometimes is ſo
great that it kindles a Feaver.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Let the Foot ſoak for ſome time in Warm Water to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Nail; then let the Surgeon place the Patient in a Chair, which is
ſomething higher than his own, and laying the Patients Foot on his Knee pare
away the Nail on the ſide. If there be a ſpace between the Nail and the
Toe, let him paſs the point of his Sciſſars under the Nail to cut it off;
but if the Nail have taken too deep root in the Fleſh, it muſt be gently
ſeparated and taken off with a Knife, and not torn away by violence.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Wrap the Toe in a Deſiccative Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter, as
<hi>de Minio,</hi> and keep that on with a narrow Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and if there be a
Flux of Blood ſtop it with ſome Styp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Water or Powder.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If an Inflammation or other Accident fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low apply

               <p>THE SIGNS which demonſtrate there is <hi>Pus</hi> under the

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Let the Artiſt place the Patient in a Situation fit for the
Operation, let him depreſs the Eye with a <hi>Speculum Oculi,</hi> and make
an Inciſion with a Lancet on the Tumour at the bottom of the <hi>Cornea,</hi>
and compreſs the Eye to ſqueeze out the <hi>Pus.</hi> Some would have the
Surgeon ſuck it out through a Pipe, when it is too thick to come out by any
other means. This Pipe muſt be made large in the middle, that ſo the
<hi>Pus</hi> may lodge in the dilated part, and not reach the Mouth; but this
Suction is hazardous becauſe there is a great danger of drawing out the
Aqueous Humour of the Eye, which is one of the Organs of Viſion, tho' this
Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour indeed may be reproduced.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING conſiſts in applying ſome mild
Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, which is not in the leaſt corroſive, ſuch as is for
inſtance <hi>Pigeons Blood.</hi> If there be an Inflammation when the Eye is
ſhut, lay a ſmall round Compreſs dipt in <hi>Roſe Water</hi> on it, and

continue to digeſt the Wound as long as you judge requiſite, and if the
Inflammation continues let the Patient bleed, uſe Clyſters, and let his
Food be Broths and the Yolks of Eggs.</p>

that a Girl of <pb n="339" facs="tcp:42110:185"/>ſix years of Age having long had a
Defluxion on the Eye; after having tryed a great many Medicines in vain, at
laſt was cured by a Seton in the Neck of the Defluxion, and the ſpot
vaniſhed of its own accord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fab. Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 26. tells us,
that a ſhooema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Son of about 15 years of Age, received a blow on the Eye
near the <hi>Iris,</hi> upon which the Aqueous Humour came away inſtantly,
and the young Man loſt his Sight. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call'd to him inſtantly,
applied the <hi>White of an Egg</hi> beaten up with a little <hi>Roſe
Water</hi> and <hi>Saffron;</hi> and then applied a Defenſative Emplaſter
on the Forehead, made of <hi>Bole Armoniack</hi> and <hi>Terra Sigillata</hi>
with <hi>Oyl of Roſes,</hi> and a little <hi>Wax</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi>
after which he gave the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a Clyſter. The next Day he gave him a Purge,
and for ſeven or eight days together dreſt the Wound with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodines, after
which he made a <hi>Collyrium</hi> with <hi>Eye-bright Water, Sugar</hi> and
<hi>Tutty prepared</hi> which he laid on the <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> and the
Patient was cured and recovered the uſe of his ſight.</p>
                  <p>This Remark demonſtrates, that the Aqueous Humour may be
reproduced in the Eye after it is loſt. This Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is eaſie to be
made in Birds, in which it ſucceeds in a very ſmall time. Mr. <hi>Nuck</hi>
late Profeſſor of Anatomy in the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi>
diſcovered a Channel creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the <hi>Sclerotis,</hi> and inſerted
into the <hi>Cornea,</hi> which ſerves to convey the Aqueous Humour into the
Eye. This he firſt obſerved in diſſecting the Eye of a
<hi>Dog-Fiſh</hi> or <hi>Galea, &amp;c.</hi> and the Channel was large enough
to receive his Probe. When he drew out the Probe the Aqueous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour did not
run out, by reaſon there was a Valve at the end of the Duct.</p>
                  <p>This Accidental Diſcovery cauſed that Gentleman to make a
more exact ſcrutiny in a Sheeps Eye, and there he found five Channels in one,
and ſix in another, which ran over the <hi>Sclerotis,</hi> and piercing the
<hi>Cornea</hi> terminated in it. He thruſt a Hogs Briſtle into each
Channel, which appeared of a black Colour. He found likewiſe two Channels in
each Eye of Dogs, one under the Abducent, and the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Adducent
Muſcles. If you deſire to obſerve theſe in the Eye of a Living Dog, you
muſt lift up the upper Eye-lid and then you will ſee the place where the
common Duct pierces the <hi>Cornea.</hi> Theſe Channels moſt commonly
proceed ſtreight forward on the <hi>Conjunctiva,</hi> but ſometimes they
turn aſide and piercing the <hi>Sclerotis,</hi> diſcharge their contents
into the bottom of the Eye.</p>

               <p>THE CAUSE of this Diſtemper is a thick Excreſcence, which

               <p>THE SIGNS. This Diſtemper is viſible of it ſelf, there is
a thick Membrane which takes its Riſe from the great Angle, and extends it
ſelf over the whole Globe of the Eye.</p>

                  <p>If this Membrane covers the Globe of the Eye, and is not fixed
to the greater Angle, lift it up and cut it off with the Sciſſars as near
as poſſible to its riſe. For the raiſing it up paſs a blunt Needle

diſapprove of this Practice, becauſe it muſt neceſſarily cauſe
great Pain and Inflammation, and for this Reaſon I ſhould rather chuſe to
make a Ligature on the Membrane near the greater Angle of the Eye to intercept
its Nouriſhment, and conſume the Membrane which covers the <hi>Cornea</hi>
with Suppuratives, or by paſſing gently the Lunat Cauſtick frequently
over it. This Cauſtick has this Advantage over all others, that it conſumes
this Excreſcence without leaving any thing in the Eye, which may irritate

that a certain Man hapning to receive a Wound on the Eye, the upper Eye-lid
grew to the Globe of the Eye, and the Phyſicians tryed ſeveral ways to free
it, till at laſt he was called in, who treated him in this manner. In the
firſt place he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him a regular Diet, purged him and bled him in
the Arm. Then he put a ſmall piece of Silk at the end of a crooked Probe, and
paſſed it under the Eye-lid, beginning <pb n="344" facs="tcp:42110:188"/>at the
leſſer Angle of the Eye. Next he drew the crooked Probe from the Eye-lid,
and left the Thread under it, with one end hanging out of the leſſer, and
the other out of the greater Angle of the Eye, and tyed both ends of the Silk
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, faſtning a piece of Lead to it of a Dram in Weight, which Lead he
could ſlide all along the Silk from one end to another, upon every different
Motion of the Patient; and this piece of Lead he took away in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
binding the Patients Eye up gently, and dropping the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Collyrium</hi> into the greater Angle of the Patients Eye three or four
times in a Day. ℞. <hi>Roſe, Plantane,</hi> and <hi>Eye-bright

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. LIII.</hi> Of Drawing Teeth.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the drawing of a Tooth out of its
Socket.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Pain of the Teeth proceeds from a ſharp Humour
which irritates the Membrane that lines their <hi>Alveoli</hi> or Sockets. The
Teeth are ſometimes rotted, or have their Surface corroded by the
ſharpneſs of the <hi>Saliva,</hi> or the Meat lodged in their
Interſtices. Sometimes they are corroded by Sweet-meats. When any one eats
hot Things, and preſently eats ſomething very cold after, the Teeth grow
black and carious; becauſe theſe putting the parts of the Teeth into
various Motions, ſeparate them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their continuity; and there
being ſeveral Intervals between their parts, they muſt of neceſſity
abſorb ſome parts of the Light, and from hence it is not difficult to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their blackneſs according to the Carteſian Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of
the cauſe of Colours.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Sometimes there is a ſmall, round, black, hole,
which by degtees encreaſes and grows larger, and the Teeth become black and
ſtinking. Pains in the Teeth are often accompanied with a great Pain in the
Head, loſs of Appetite, want of Sleep, and Convulſions.</p>
               <p>The Teeth are ſmall longiſh Bones, ſmooth and hard, which
are ſtuck in their Sockets as a Nail in a piece of Wood. This ſort of
Articulation as I remarked before, is called <hi>Gomphoſis.</hi> They begin
to appear in young Children, about the ſeventh or eighth Month. The
<hi>Inciſores</hi> or Fore-teeth of the upper Jaw appear firſt, and then
thoſe of the lower Jaw; the Dog-teeth come next forth, and the Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
laſt of all. When the Teeth firſt come out they tear the Gums and the
<hi>Perioſteum,</hi> which lines the Socket, which creates ſo great Pain,
that People uſually do account a Childs Life very dubious, till the Teeth are
come forth, and indeed with very good reaſon, ſince there are ſo many
Accidents attend the breeding of them, as Pains, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, Feavers,
Epilepſies, Vomiting, Looſneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conjecture Teeth are formed in this manner. The Membrane which
inveſts the Teeth being a Texture of an <pb n="347" facs="tcp:42110:189"/>Infinity of
ſmall Veſſels, ſpues out glutinous Matter which forms a ſort of
<hi>Stratum,</hi> and by congeſtion of more of theſe <hi>Strata</hi> on one
another, which in time fill up and riſe beyond the Cavity of the
<hi>Alveoli</hi> the Teeth are formed, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part being preſt in
the Maſtication of the Meat, form a Cortical part harder than the internal.
The ſame Veſſels entring the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Teeth, ſupply them
with Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>The Teeth are commonly divided into <hi>Inciſores</hi> or
Fore-teeth, <hi>Canini</hi> or Dog-teeth, and <hi>Molares</hi> or Grinders.
There are moſt commonly 32 Teeth in both Jaws, <hi>viz.</hi> Sixteen in the
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Jaw, and ſixteen in the lower, or Four Fore-teeth, two Dog-teeth, and
ten Grinders in each Jaw. The <hi>Inciſores</hi> or Fore-teeth are a little
flat and ſharp, ſomething Convex with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and hollow within, having never
more than one Root. The Grinders are large and unequal, and have their
<hi>Baſis</hi> irregular, for the better grinding and comminution of the
Aliment. Theſe have ſome one, ſome two, and others three Roots, and in
above two thouſand Teeth which I have viewed, I never found one that had more
than three Roots diſtinct from each other.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>When the Teeth are carious and rotten, the beſt way is to
pull them out to be delivered from the continual Pain and ſtinking Breath,
and prevent them from corrupting their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral Inſtruments uſed on this occaſion,
as the Polican to pull out large Teeth which are far in the Mouth. The Paces,
when they are not ſo far, and the Punch, when the Teeth are broken off
cloſe to the Gum, and there is no hold.</p>
                  <p>But whatſoever the Inſtrument be with which you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Operation, place the Patient on a Cuſhion on the Floor, or on a low Seat,
and let the Artiſt ſtand behind him, and opening his Mouth as wide as he
can, if it be one of the hinder Teeth let him uſe the Polican, one end of
which muſt reſt on the fore-teeth, having wrapt it in a Cloth for fear of
breaking thoſe Teeth, and then having hookt the moveable branch of the
Inſtrument, let him pull it ſtrongly and ſo bring out the Tooth; but in
doing this he muſt take care of the ſound Teeth, for by reſting too much
on them, he may chance to break them.</p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:42110:190"/>
                  <p>Great care muſt be taken that the Artiſt do not miſtake
a ſound Tooth for an unſound one; and in this caſe he muſt not always
rely on the Patients account, for it often happens that the contiguous Teeth
being painful, he points to one of them; and therefore in this caſe the
ſureſt way is to take that which is black and rotten.</p>
                  <p>If the Tooth be not too far within the Mouth, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
may make uſe of the Paces. If the Tooth which is to be drawn be in the upper
Jaw, the Handle of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument muſt be turned down, and you muſt take
hold of the Tooth as cloſe to the Gum as may be, having firſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the Gum with a Fleam, for the better doing this. In drawing the Tooth out,
there are three Motions at once, <hi>viz.</hi> turning it to the right and
left, and pulling it out of the Socket.</p>
                  <p>When a Tooth is broken off near the Socket, the Punch is to be
made uſe of. For this purpoſe ſeparate the Gum from the Tooth as far as
is poſſible, and apply the two Teeth of the Punch as low as may be, and
puſh it ſtrongly outward.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Some times there is ſo large a Flux of Blood
after the pulling out of a Tooth, that it is difficult to ſtop it. For this
purpoſe make a huge Tent of Lint as big as an Egg, and dipping it in the
Styptick Water, put it into the Socket of the Tooth which is drawn out, and let
the Patient preſs it with his Jaw, and when he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it
himſelf, its magnitude will be preſſure enough. If there be any great
loſs of Blood, let the Patient gargle his Mouth with <hi>Oxycrate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE CURE. When the Teeth are not carious, they muſt not be
pulled out, though perhaps they put the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to a great deal of Pain. In
this caſe let him take <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine Camphorated</hi> into his Mouth,
and lie in ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture that the Liquour may touch the Tooth which is
affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Since Pains in the Teeth moſt commonly proceed from an Acrimony of
the <hi>Lympha,</hi> whoſe Fomes is in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, let the Patient take 7
or 8 grains of <hi>Emetick Tartar</hi> in Broth, for it is found by experience
that Vomiting has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cured Pains in the Teeth.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Fluxion is very ſucceſsfully diverted by
bleeding in the oppoſite Arm. Detergent and Emollient Clyſters are very
uſeful, and ſo are Anodyne Cataplaſms made with Crumbs of <hi>Whitebread,
Yelks of Eggs, Saffron</hi> and <hi>Camphire</hi> applied to the Patients Cheek
to abate the Pain. <hi>Lauda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42110:190"/>Lint dipt in a Solution of it, made in Water or Milk and
put into the Ear or Mouth, is an Excellent Remedy. To hinder the progreſs of
the Carioſity of a Tooth, put <hi>Oyl of Guajacum</hi> into it.</p>

                     <hi>An Extract of a Letter concerning the Teeth of divers

                  </p>
                  <p>The Structure of the Teeth in moſt Animals, ſhews us their
Inclinations, and the Diet on which they feed.</p>
                  <p>Some Animals have their Inciſive Teeth long and ſharp,
their Dog-teeth long and crooked, and their Grinders une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and pointed, as
Bears, Boars, Lyons, Wolfs, Tygers, Squirrels, Cats, Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all
which are Carnivorous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, and live upon rapine. Their Grinders ſerve
for the Maſtication and the Comminution of their Prey, the inciſive Teeth
to cut it, and the Dog-teeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in the Mouth and tear it. All
theſe Animals have at leaſt three fourths of their Teeth within the Jaw,
which makes them much ſtronger than if a greater part of the Teeth were
out.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Animals which live on Herbage, as Oxen and Sheep have
no <hi>Inciſores,</hi> but have ſlat round Teeth in their lower Jaw, and do
rather pull up than cut the Graſs which they eat, and the moſt part of
theſe Animals chew the Cud. River Fowl, as Geeſe, Ducks, Herns, Swans, have
a long Bill which is round and flat at the end, and have a ſoft Flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
Membrane in their lower Jaw, which helps them to ſwallow their Meat with
eaſe. The ſides of their Bill are like ſo many ſmall ſaws, with which
they take up lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fiſh and pluck Weeds.</p>
                  <p>Birds which have a hard, crooked, ſtrong, Bill, with ſharp
edges eaſily tear and cut Fleſh, and for that reaſon are Carnivorous, and
ſuch for the moſt part are Birds of Prey, as the Eagle, Hawk, Raven,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Birds which have their Bill ſtrait, ſlender, with a
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in it, as the Linnet, Goldfinch, and Sparrow, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly feed on
Seeds. The end of their Bill is cut ſharp, and they make uſe of it to break
the Seeds, and cut Blades of Graſs.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Birds which have the edges of their Bill indented, as
the greateſt part of River Fowl have, feed for the moſt part upon Weeds,
and theſe Indentations ſerve as a ſaw with <pb n="350" facs="tcp:42110:191"/>which
they cut them, and pull them up, as Geeſe, Ducks, Swans. River Fowl which
only live on Fiſhing, have moſt commonly in their Bill a little ſet of
Teeth, by the help of which they keep the Fiſh which they catch in their
Mouths. Theſe ſmall points are very large in the Birds called
<hi>Fiber,</hi> which has Teeth all along his Bill, which are long pointed, and
turned in towards the Throat.</p>
                  <p>Fiſh which have little pointed Teeth, only live upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little Fiſh which they catch, and theſe Teeth which point toward the
Throat, ſerve not ſo much to Maſticate, as to retain the Fiſh which
they have in their Mouths. Thoſe Fiſh which have their Tongue and the
Palate of their Mouth paved and ſcaly, only live on Shell-Fiſh, and break
the ſhell to eat the Meat contained in it. Tortoiſes which live in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
have Teeth quite down to the Throat, and uſe them for the Comminution of
thoſe Plants which grow at the bottom of the Sea which they feed on. Land
Tortoiſes have not only Teeth in their Jaws and on their Tongue, which are
not directly oppoſite, but enter one between the other, ſerve only for the
retention and not for the Comminution of the Aliments, and <hi>Steno</hi> in
his Diſcourſe <hi>de Cane Carcharia</hi> informs us, that Fiſh has ſix
hundred Teeth, and has ſome ſtill come forth as long as he lives. This
Fiſh has ſeveral ranges of Teeth in each Jaw, which are hard, ſharp, and
pointed, the greateſt part of which are an Inch in length, and ſerve only
for the Retention, and not for the Comminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Food, which is evident
ſince very large Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are often found entire in its Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Animals whoſe Tongues are ſet with large pointed
<hi>Papillae</hi> and have theſe turned toward the Throat, make uſe of them
in ſwallowing their Meat, and they ſerve to hinder it from falling out of
their Mouth; of this kind are Lions, Tygers, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, Panthers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then cover the whole Surface of the Tongue. Some large
Fiſhes have their Tongue covered with Briſties which form a ſort of
Bruſh, and ſerve to retain the Food.</p>
                  <p>The Sea-Fox has his Tongue covered with ſmall pieces of
Bone, which are not bigger than the points of Needles, and theſe are white,
ſquare, and very hard.</p>
                  <p>The Cod-Fiſh has Teeth at the bottom of his Throat, whoſe
points turn inwards, and it is probable they only ſerve to retain the
Aliment. Theſe Teeth are hard pointed, cloſe, and make a ſort of File,
and there are four of them, <hi>viz.</hi> two above and two below, which
anſwer toeach other.</p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:42110:191"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Raia</hi> has three or four ranks of hard, ſmooth,
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Bones cut Lozangewiſe, and ranged in very good order, and
theſe Bones are the teeth with which they Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate their Meat. The Carp
has grinders which ſerve for the Comminution of his Meat, he has ſix in the
upper Jaw, ranged three and three together; and in the lower Jaw this Fiſh
has a Cartilaginous Bone in the ſhape of a flat Olive, which does the office
of Teeth. In the Seas of <hi>Canada</hi> there is a Fiſh which has both the
Jaws flat, which ſerves for the grinding of the Meat. Theſe have flat Teeth
cloſe againſt each other, and very hard, and with his Teeth he cracks the
ſhell firſt, and then feeds on the Fiſh. The Fiſh called <hi>La
Vielle</hi> has flat teeth quite to the farther end of his Throat, which
ſeems to be paved with them. The Fiſh called the <hi>Requiem</hi> has its
teeth an Inch, large, flat, and Triangular, with ſmall Indentations on the
ſide. There are three ranks in each Jaw, and this Animal is ſo ſtrong,
and his teeth ſo ſharp, that he can bite off the Thigh of a Man at
once.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viper</hi> has two great moveable teeth in his upper
Jaw, as well as the Sea-Frogg. There is a Serpent in <hi>America,</hi> which
has a great number of teeth in each Jaw, which ſerve for the ſwallowing of
his Prey, and whilſt the teeth in one Jaw remain unmov'd and ſerve to
retain it, the teeth of the other are thruſt out to hook it, and bring it in
again; whilſt it draws it in the teeth in the other Jaw are thruſt out, and
by this Alternate Motion, the Prey is conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Throat.</p>
                  <p>The Flander bruiſes ſhells with his flat Mouth.</p>
                  <p>The Parrot eats very readily, becauſe its upper Jaw is
moveable, and articulated in ſuch manner with that; though the lower Jaw be
much ſhorter than the upper, yet he can thruſt it to the end.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Birds which have the upper Jaw crookt, have the lower
Jaw ſhort, but ſo notwithſtanding that they can thruſt it to the top of
the upper. Thoſe Birds which have a long ſtrait Bill, have not this
property of moving their lower Jaw, nor can they eat ſo well as a Raven.
Small Birds whoſe Bill is ſharp and cutting, and has a Channel in it, and
who only live upon Seeds, bring them to the ſides of their ſharp Bill, and
turn them often about till they have found the Juncture of the Seed, and then
they break it.</p>
                  <p>Toads and Serpents have ſo large a Throat, that they can
ſwallow whole Fiſhes, and when they happen to take <pb n="352" facs="tcp:42110:192"/>them wrong, they very dextrouſly toſs them into the Air, and
catch them again by the Tail, that ſo the Gills may not ſtick in their
Throat. Herons do not make uſe of their Bill to break ſhells, but ſwallow
them entire, the Heat of their Belly relaxes the Muſcle which keeps them
ſhut, and when they perceive the ſhells open, they Vomit them up again to
eat the Fleſh. Boars do not employ their Tuſhes in Maſtication, but make
uſe of them in tearing up Plants by the Roots.</p>
                  <p>The Crocodile has no <hi>Inciſores</hi> nor Grinders, all
that it has are Dog-teeth, which are extremely white, hard, round, and pointed,
with a Channel encompaſſing them all round, their Root is hollow and twice
as long as the Tooth, and they are diſpos'd in ſuch a manner, that they
leave as much ſpace full as empty.</p>
                  <p>Crabs have three teeth placed at the bottom of their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and move that part in the comminution of their Meat. The Fiſh called
<hi>Orbis,</hi> has four teeth in its <hi>Gula</hi> as big as the Inciſive
teeth of a Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Hares, Squirrels, and Rats, have long Inciſive teeth,
ſtrong enough to gnaw any hard Body; and Beavers have very large and ſtrong
ones, with which they can cut off great Branches of Trees for the building of
their Hutts. Theſe paſs one over another without meeting, when the Animal
makes uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>The Inſect call'd <hi>Spondylis</hi> has two teeth which

                  <p>Beſides theſe mentioned which are drawn from the teeth,
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has long ſince given us ſeveral other Marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to diſtinguiſh the ſeveral Natures of Animals, and their manner of
Living.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Miſcelanea Curioſa, Obſ.</hi> 5. There is a
Relation of a Child of a year old, very lean and of a livid Complexion, who
upon breeding his teeth had ſeveral white ones, and after ſome time a black
one came our. The Relations were ſomething ſurprized at this, however
finding that in a whole years time it did not incommode the Child, they
deferred acquainting any Phyſician with the Accident; but perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the
teeth of the ſame ſide which came out after to be black, they called in a
Surgeon, who being ignorant of the Nature of the Diſtemper Scarified the
Tumour on the Gum, whereupon not only the Gum it ſelf, but the whole Cheek
Ulcerated. As ſoon as the Surgeon ſaw this, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Relations to
call in a Phyſician, who found the <pb n="353" facs="tcp:42110:192"/>Diſtemper to be a
Raging <hi>Cancer,</hi> with a horrible Ulcer, proceeding from improper
Remedies applied to the Part. Upon this to palliate the Caſe, he adviſed
the Patient to a moiſt and cooling Diet, the Child having a Hectick Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and preſcribed ſome Lotions to gargle its Mouth, but notwithſtanding the
uſe of all Means which could be thought of, the <hi>Cancer</hi> extended to
the Temporal Muſcle, and the Patient died convuls'd.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs it is a thing without precedent, that ſo furious
a Tumour ſhould extend it ſelf ſo far, without affecting the other
Teeth.</p>
                  <p>It happened ſome time ſince, that a certain Perſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pulling out a Tooth, loſt above a pint of Blood by the Wound, and the
Operator could not ſtop it, but at laſt the Flux was ſuppreſſed by a
Tent wetted in the <hi>Styptick Water</hi> before mentioned.</p>

                     <hi>Fabr. Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 21. tells
us, that a certain Prioreſs of 40 years of Age, being troubled with a
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain in her Teeth, having tryed ſeveral Remedies in vain, at laſt
had <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> put in them, upon which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the
Cauſtick Nature of the Medicine, or the continuation of the Fluxion,
ſeveral of her Teeth rotted, broke and came away, leaving ſeveral Cavernous
<hi>Fiſtula's</hi> in the Chin, and Ulcers under the Glands, which voided
above three pints of Matter every Day. At length all the Teeth rotted and ſhe
became Feaveriſh, and the Bones of the Head were fouled.</p>

Parts deficient.</head>
               <p>THIS is the <hi>Artificial ſupplying ſome Part which is
defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in Humane Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The moſt ordinary occaſion of this, is the
Extirpation or Amputation of ſome Limb which cannot be cured by any other
means; ſometimes indeed ſome Member or other is wanting in Children when
they are born, or is after eaten off by Venereal Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The Defect is viſible.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Sometimes the ſmall Bone in the Roof of the Mouth falls as
in the Pox, and then the Patients Meat comes out of his Noſe; and there are
many words which he cannot pronounce plain. To remedy this Infirmity, take a
thin Plate of Silver of a Figure fit to ſtop the Hole, make a little King in
the midſt of it, and put in a ſmall bit of ſpunge, and thruſt this into
the hole of the Palate, the Moiſture of the Mouth ſwells this ſpunge, and
faſtens the Plate ſo cloſe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that it is very difficult to
draw it out, and by ſtaying there it ſupplies the place of the Bone which
is loſt.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the tip of the Tongue is cut off by the Teeth, and
this is occaſioned either by Convulſions, or ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Blow under
the Chin. When this happens, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient cannot pronounce many words by
reaſon the tip of the Tongue cannot ſtrike the Roof of the Mouth. For the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying this Inconvenience, take a ſmall Spoon about the bigneſs of a
Silver penny, and apply this over the Tongue in ſuch manner, that its Cavity
may be downward and its Convexity upwards, that it may ſtrike the Roof of the
Mouth, and by this means the Patient may pronounce his words Articulately.</p>
                  <p>When any of the Teeth fall out make new ones of Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and
put them in the place of the other, faſtning them with a Silver Wire.</p>
                  <p>If the Ball of the Eye fall out of the Orbit, make one of
Glaſs and put it in its ſtead.</p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:42110:193"/>
                  <p>If there be any loſs of ſubſtance, as for inſtance, if
a Woman has loſt a portion of Fleſh in her Arm, or a Man part of his
Noſe, or the like, then cut ſuperficially the Part which you intend to
prolong, and cut ſuperficially the Arm or ſome Fleſhy part in any
perſon who will ſubmit to it, and apply the two Wounds to each other; for
by this means they will be agglutinated in the ſame manner as the Lips of all
recent Wounds, and when they are once grown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cut of as much Fleſh
as is neceſſary to ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the Part applied, and form
it into ſhape with a pair of Sciſſars.</p>
                  <p>If you would thus inoculate, when the Noſe happens to be cut
off Scarifie the ſides a little, and make an Inciſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fleſh,
put the Noſe in, and when it is well agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cut off as much as you
think convenient, and pierce it to make Noſtrils, putting in two Pipes till
the part be Cicatrized.</p>
                  <p>If Children have crooked Legs, put them on Boots of a firm
Leather, and in time they will become ſtrait, as they grow.</p>
                  <p>If the Arms are contorted, let ſome ſtreight Splints be
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied on the ſide which is bent, and then make a Bandage, and by degrees
the Member will come to its Natural State. In the laſt place, when you make
any Artificial Member, let them have the ſame Motion as the Natural.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. In reſtoring diſtorted Bones, Boots, Splints,
and other like Machines are not ſufficient, but you muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſe
Emollient and Relaxing Cataplaſms to make the Bone flexible, and the part
muſt be bound ſtraiter by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as you find it recovers its right
Figure; for if it be bound too ſtrait at firſt, there is danger of its
Gangrening.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LV.</hi> Of Transfuſion and Injections into the
Veins.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Injection of ſome Liquours into the
Veſſels of an Animal, or the Transfuſion of the Blood of one into the
Body of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Intention of Transfuſion, is that the Medicine
may act more promptly and effectually. This may be practiſed in Paralytick
Perſons, when the Patient is diſabled from Swallowing, by a Debility or
Convulſion of the Nervous Fibres of the Gullet, or in Hypochondraical and
Scorbutick Perſons, or when ſome Styptick Vapours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringe the Throat,
and hinder Deglutition or the like, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from a ſwelling of the
Tonſils, or Inflammation of the Muſcles of the Throat in a Quinſie, or in
ſuch Perſons as have a natural Antipathy to all Medicines, and cannot
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in their Stomach; or laſtly, when Medicines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive too great
an Alteration in the <hi>Primae viae,</hi> and loſe their effect. No internal
Medicines taken by the Mouth, can act ſo promptly as Infuſions in acute
Diſtempers, as <hi>Syncopes,</hi> Palpitations, Apoplexies,
<hi>Vertigo's,</hi> Epilepſies. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions put the Blood into a gentle
Fermentation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Hypochondriack Diſtempers, Convulſive
Aſthma's, all Chronical radicated Diſeaſes, and are of uſe in all Acute
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory and Malignant Feavers.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The occaſion of making Injections, are thoſe
Diſtempers above mentioned.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Before you make any Injection, it is neceſſary to
conſider well which Veſſel is moſt proper for this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rpoſe. In the firſt place
Arteries are not very proper; for if the Inciſion be large, it muſt
neceſſarily be dangerous, and cauſe an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuriſm, and the Wound be hard
to heal, becauſe the Veſſel lies deep in the Fleſh; on the contrary, if
it be very ſmall it will be very difficult to introduce the Inſtrument.
Beſides the injected Liquour ought to be conveyed to the Heart, the moſt
direct way imaginable; and for this reaſon the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es are not ſo proper as the Veins, and the
Veins in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <pb n="357" facs="tcp:42110:194"/>Syſtan ought to be preferred to
thoſe in the lower, and the Jugular to the Veins of the Arm. However ſince
the latter are more acceſſible, and more eaſily managed than the former,
for the moſt part it is more convenient to make the Operation in them. When
you have choſe the Veſſel, chafe the part with <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Elder
Water</hi> very hot, or <hi>Spirit of Wine Camphorated.</hi> After this make
two Ligatures, <hi>viz.</hi> one above the place where you intend to make the
Injection to ſtop the Blood, and cauſe the Vein to riſe, and the other
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to keep the Blood from flowing out, and hindring the Operation. When the
Inciſion is made lay your Finger on to cloſe it till the Inſtrument be
in, and then unbind the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature above, to give the Infuſion room to paſs
preſſing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> upwards to
promore its paſſing on, and when the Injection is make, cloſe the Orifice
in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame manner as in
Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and unbind the Ligature beneath, that ſo the Blood may continue
its Circulation, and carry the It jection with it.</p>
                  <p>Let the Inciſion be made with a Lancet, and the Injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a Bladder full of Liquour, at the end of which there muſt be a Silver
Syphon ſlender and crooked towards the point, that ſo it may the better
paſs up the Vein, or you may uſe a Silver Syringe, which is much better in
all reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Transfuſion of Blood out of the Veins of one Animal into
another, is performed in this manner. Take the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotid Artery, for inſtance,
of a Dog or any other Animal, and ſeparate it from the Nerve which
accompanies it, and lay the Artery bare for about an Inch in length, then make
a ſtrong Ligature on the upper part, and another Ligature below towards the
Heart with ſlip knots, which you may loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen as occaſion ſhall require.
When you have made theſe two Knots, paſs two Threads under the Artery
between the two Ligatures, and then open the Artery and put a Quill into it,
and tie it cloſe with a double Thread on the Pipe, and put a good ſtopple
into it. When this is done, lay the Jugular Vein of any other Animal open an
Inch and a half in length, and make a ſlip knot at each extremity; and
between theſe two knots put two Threads under the Vein as you did in the
Artery, and make an Inciſion into the Vein, and thruſt in the two pipes,
one into the lower part to receive the Blood and convey it to the Heart, and
the other into the upper, which comes from the Head by which the Blood of this
ſecond Dog may flow out on the ground, <pb n="358" facs="tcp:42110:195"/>and when the
Pipes are diſpoſed in this manner, put in a ſtopple.</p>
                  <p>When all things are thus prepared, let the Dogs be tyed and
laid one by the ſide of the other, and then begin to unſtop the Pipe which
goes into the deſcending part of the Jugular Vein of the Recipient Animal,
and after that unſtop likewiſe the Pipe which goes into the Artery of the
other Dog, and inſert two or three Pipes between them: When you have done
this untie the Ligatures, and the Blood will paſs in a rapid current from the
Artery of the firſt Animal into the Veins of the other. When you perceive the
Blood paſſes, unſtop the Pipe which is inſerted into the aſcending
part of the Jugular Vein of the Recipient Animal, (not continually but by
intervals, (having firſt made a Ligature, or at leaſt compreſſing with
your Fingers the Veins on the oppoſite ſide) and let the Blood run out upon
the Floor, as you judge his Strength can bear, till the Emittent begins to cry,
and ſo faints, falls into Convulſions, and ſo dies. Then take both Pipes
out of the Jugular Vein, and having tyed the ſlip knot ſtrait and firm, cut
the Veins aſunder above it. This may be done without the leaſt
Inconvenience, one Jugular alone being ſufficient to convey the Blood to the
Head and upper parts, becauſe the two Veins communicate about the
<hi>Larynx</hi> by a large <hi>Anaſtomoſis.</hi> When you have done this,
ſtitch up the skin and let the Dog go.</p>
                  <p>Let not the diſtance between the Doggs be ſo great, as to
ſtretch the Veins and Arteries, which would very much hinder the conveying of
the Blood from one to the other You muſt from time to time obſerve the
beating of the Blood in the Jugular Vein, and when you cannot perceive this,
you may conclude that the paſſage is ſtopt by ſome Clods of concreted
Blood, and when this happens, you muſt take the Pipe out of the Artery of the
Emittent Dog, and unſtop it with a Probe to clear the paſſage. This is
very apt to happen when the Emittent Dog is almoſt ſpent, for then the
Heart projects the Blood feebly, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> coagulates much ſooner; and therefore for the making this
Experiment with more Succeſs, let the Emittent Animal be larger than the
Recipient; or if you pleaſe, you may take two or three A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, provided you
let as much Blood out of ths Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as you convey into it; for otherwiſe
it muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be ſuffocated.</p>
                  <p>The Animals which emit the Blood, ought as near as is
poſſible to be of the ſame Conſtitution and Age, and for 
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42110:195"/>ſome days before to be fed with like Nouriſhment,
that ſo their Blaod may be of the ſame Temper.</p>
                  <p>Silver or Copper Pipes are better than Quills, and theſe
muſt be a little crooked and ſlender at the ends, that ſo one end may go
into the Quill, and the other into the Vein or Artery with a little riſing
edge, for the better faſtning the Thread.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING after this Operation, conſiſts in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
good Compreſs on the Veſſel which is opened, and making the ſame
Bandage as in Bleeding, and then dreſſing the Wound.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. The Injection muſt be adapted to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
which you intend to cure. Purgative and Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines are by no means
proper to be injected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all Purgatives there is a latent Malignity
which weakens the Patient exceedingly, and cauſes Trembling of the Knees, a
lean Viſage, and a ſinking in of the Eyes, when they are taken by the
Mouth, and by conſequence cannot fail of cauſing much greater diſorders
when they are injected by the Veins, and are admitted into the Maſs of Blood
crude and unprepared. We find by Experience, Purgatives injected into the Veins
of a Dog, create mighty Diſturbances and terrible Symptoms, and Antimonial
Inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions cauſe violent Vomitings and kill them.</p>
                  <p>Diuretick Injections by vertue of a Nitrous Salt, diſpoſe
the Blood for a more eaſie ſeparation of the Seroſities in the Kidneys.
Sudorificks may be injected ſucceſsfully, when the Patient cannot take them
by the Mouth, or has taken them without effect, which laſt point indeed ought
to be conſidered before any Injections are made at any time.</p>
                  <p>Authors commend half a dram of Spirit of <hi>Sal.
Armoniack,</hi> to which if you pleaſe you may add <hi>a dram of Spirit of
Wine Camphorated;</hi> or <hi>Volatil Salt of Sal</hi> Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack with
Heinſius's, <hi>Antipeſtilential Oyl,</hi> and ſo form a ſort of
<hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum,</hi> a dram of which if it be injected, is an
excellent Sudoriſick in Malignant Feavers. <hi>Humme Blood, Stags.
Vipers</hi> or <hi>Serpents Blood,</hi> are good Sudorificks. As for Cordials,
<hi>Cinnamon</hi> and <hi>Ambergreaſe</hi> are the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.
<hi>Spirit of Cinnamon</hi> together with diſtilled <hi>Oyl of Amber,
Ginger</hi> and Volatil Salt of <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Ambergreaſe</hi> prepared with <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Roſes,</hi> is excellent. Injections of <hi>Opium</hi> are good to calm
the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity and Fury of the Spirits. Preparations of <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
and <hi>Ambergreaſe</hi> are admirable in <hi>Syncapes,</hi> ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Vinegar</hi> made of good <hi>Wine,</hi> and rectifyed with a mixture of
<hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Roſes</hi> Ambrated. But if the
<hi>Syncope</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a coagulation of the Blood, Volatil Salts are
the moſt proper Remedies to correct the Acid, and diſſolve it promptly.
For this Reaſon <hi>Tincture of Coral</hi> with <hi>Volatil Salt</hi> of
<hi>Tartar</hi> in a proper Vehicle, is a very good Remedy in
<hi>Deliquiums</hi> and Palpitations of the Heart. The Ingredients of
Apoplectick Injections, muſt be the Volatil Salts and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Plants and
Animals; for inſtance, of <hi>Harts-Horn, Skulls</hi> and <hi>Bones of Men,
Staggs</hi> and <hi>Humane Blood, Volatil Salt</hi> of <hi>Amber</hi> is a
glorious Medicine, and ſo is <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wire.</hi> and <hi>Compound
Theriacal Water. Spirit</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Valley</hi> or <hi>Black
Cherries</hi> impregnated with <hi>Volatil Salt of Hartſhorn</hi> and a
little <hi>Camphire</hi> by ſeveral Cohobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is an excellent Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Epileptick Injections may be made of Specificks actuated with
<hi>Camphire,</hi> or allayed with <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>Opium.</hi> A
Spirit drawn from the <hi>Secundines of a Woman,</hi> are very good; and there
is a mighty Antepileptick Virtue in <hi>Peacocks, Storks, Lions,</hi> and

                  <hi>CHAP. LVI.</hi> Of the Bones in general, and of their
Structure and manner of Nutrition.</head>
               <p>BEfore I deliver the Method of reducing Fractures and Luxations,
I think it not a miſs to premiſe a general <hi>Idea</hi> of the Bones, with
their ſtructure and manner of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
               <p>The Bones are hard, and light parts which lie within the
Fleſh. Theſe are the Stabiliment which ſupport and give ſhape to the
whole Fabrick, and the Muſcles which move the various parts terminate in
them. Their ſubſtance in Adults appears uniform upon a Tranſient View,
and for this reaſon the Ancients did ſuppoſe them to be Simple and
Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous Bodies; but in a <hi>Foetus</hi> of a Month old, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear only
to be a Congeries of Fibres of different kinds, as Veins, Arteries, Nerves,
Lymphaeducts, and compos'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly of the ſame Materials with other
Fleſh. Each Fluid circulates through its proper Veſſels, in the ſame
manner as in all other parts of the Body, and the only difference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in the degrees of hardneſs which the Bones have, which does not in the
leaſt alter their Figure, or obſtruct the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and returning of the
Liquours which ſerve for their Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>The Ancient Phyſicians imagined them to be ſimple and
ſpermatick Subſtances, which they founded upon their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing like
hardned Glew, and not being reproduced when they are once cut off. Nature,
ſay they, cures all Hurts in any part by the firſt or ſecond Intention;
that is, either by reproducing the ſame Subſtance, as in all parts that are
formed of Blood, or ſupplying the Defect by a <hi>Callus,</hi> or ſome like
Acceſſory Subſtance, and thoſe parts which admit only of this latter
way, are all Spermatick; they imagined that the Bones were formed in the ſame
manner as Stones and Minerals in the Bowels of the Earth, by a ſubſiding of
the groſs and terreſtrial Parts of the Seed; but this Opinion is refuted,
by reflecting on the Structure of the Bones, which plainly appear to be
Vaſcular, or a Congeries of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres with <hi>Veſiculae</hi> between them,
which communicate with each other; indeed they ſeem only to be Elongations of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42110:197"/>the Tendons, and there is no Bone in the Body without a
Tendon annexed to it, and the Bones in time become di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the
Tendons by their hardneſs. The Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons are ſometimes though rarely found,
Oſſified as well as Cartilages and Membranes, which are an Expanſion and
Texture of Tendinous Fibres, as the <hi>Falx</hi> of the <hi>Dura Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and a portion of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> which ſometimes is found Bony in old
Bodies. The Bone which is found in the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Heart of a Stag
or Ox, is nothing elſe but the Mouth of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> in which the
Valves are Planted, oſſified, and the Tendinous part of the end of Feathers
in Fowls, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten oſſified, likewiſe all which proves the truth of our
Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Ancients thought the Accetion of the Bones like other
Mineral Bodies, to proceed from the congeſtion of Matter which lodging on the
Part and concreting there, in time formed ſeveral <hi>Strala</hi> lying one
over another; but this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is deſtroyed by diſcovering their true
Compoſition, and that they conſiſt of Fibres and Channels by which their
Imperceptible Nouriſhment is conveyed to the moſt remote extremities.</p>
               <p>The Ancients for want of Knowledge in Anatomy, and diſcovering
the Veins and Arteries which every where run through the Bones, did believe
them to be nouriſhed by the Marrow, becauſe that Oleous ſubſtance is
not only contained in them, but has the ſame Colour, Taſt, and Sulphurous
Scent with them, and humects their Subſtance; But ſince Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acts
in an uniform manner, it is not probable that this can be the Nutritious Juyce,
ſince the Bones of the Ear are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſolid, and ſome other hollow
Bones inſtead of Marrow, only have a Membrane interſpers'd with Arteries
and Veins, or Foliaceous Bony Expanſions with numerous Blood-Veſſels, as
the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the Brain. The Shells of Crawfiſh which are a ſort of
Bone are deſtitute of Marrow, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have a Muſcle for the moving their
parts. The <hi>Cham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> has no Marrow in the Skull, but only the Temporal
Muſcles which are contained under make their exit, from whence it may be very
well inferred, that the Bones are not nouriſhed by the Marrow.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Engliſh</hi> Anatomiſts have imagined the Bones to
be nouriſhed by the Nervous Juyce, which they are induced to believe,
becauſe that is of the ſame colour with the Bones, and abounds in the
Joynts, and near the inſertion of the Tendons. They imagine this Liquour
being diſcharged from <pb n="364" facs="tcp:42110:198"/>the Nerves into the Muſcles,
inſinuates it ſelf into the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous Fibres, which are continuous to the
Bone; but ſince theſe Gentlemen have not hitherto proved the Nerves are
hollow, or that the Liquour found near the Joynts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the
Tendons proceeds from them, their Opinion is without Foundation. It is
therefore more rational, to think that this Oyly Matter is filtred through the
Glands in the Ligaments of the Joynts, and ſerves to humect and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe parts ſupple, and help their Motion, and that the Blood is their
Nutriment. An Objection I confeſs may be raiſed, that the Bones and divers
other parts of the Body are very diſſimilar; and therefore it is not
probable their Nutriment ſhould be one and the ſame ſubſtance, to this
I think we may reply, that the Blood however it appear to be one uniform
Liquour is compos'd of parts very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in their Colour, Conſiſtence,
and Quality, as appears by the ſeparation, when it is expos'd to the Air in a
Porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, beſides the parts of the Blood may aſſume a new
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, according to the various filtrations they undergo, and the
ſame Matter modified in theſe different manners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpenſed to
all parts of the Body, may lodge in thoſe Pores which are fitted to receive
it.</p>
               <p>For the confirmation of this Doctrine, and the evincing the
Circulation of the Blood through the Bones, there needs no other proof than
this; that in the Bones of Recent born Animals, one may perceive ſome drops
of Fluid Blood in their Subſtance, and the Cavities of the Bones are red, add
to this, that when a Bone exfoliates, and a ſmall Plate comes off, there
always appears Blood beneath.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Marrow.</head>
                  <p>The Marrow is a ſort of ſubtil and penetrating Oyl,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared out of the more unctuous part of the Blood and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſmall
<hi>Veſiculae,</hi> which are interſperſed with many Veins and
Arteries.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> who have nicely examined the
Structure of Trees, find a very great Analogy between them and Animal Bones,
the Pith being nothing more than a Collection of <hi>Veſiculae</hi> or
ſmall Bladders, which contain the Sap in the ſame manner, as the Marrow is
contained in Animal Bones.</p>
                  <p>When the Blood in its Circulation arrives at the narrow
Extremities of the Arteries, the fine ſubtil Oyl is thrown off and conveyed
by certain ſmall Channels into the Cavities of <pb n="365" facs="tcp:42110:198"/>the
Bones where it is repoſited, for the uſe which Nature has deſigned it,
however it is not wholly lodged here, but ſome portion is received into the
Veins, and circulates with the Blood. By this means it is prevented from
corrupting, as all Animal Liquours muſt of neceſſity do, when they are
once extravaſated and ceaſe to circulate. This Balſamick ſubſtance is
of very great uſe to ſheath the vitious Salts, and reduce the Blood to a
good and laudable temper, and make it more fluid and better diſpoſed for
Circulation. This is that which the Antients underſtood by their <hi>Humidum
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicale:</hi> Some portion of this Oyl inſinuating it ſelf into the
Poroſities of the Bones, makes them more ſupple, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in
ſuperannuated Bodies, and ſuch as have an inveterate Pox where the Marrow
is waſted, the Bones are more brittle.</p>

                  <head>Of the <hi>Callus,</hi> and the manner how it is
formed.</head>
                  <p>When a Bone is broke, there is a Tumour grows around it, which
is called a <hi>Callus.</hi> This proceeds from a congeſtion of the
Nutritious Juyce, which flows out from the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the divided
Veſſels, and is concreted around. The ſame thing happens upon dividing
the Fibres, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Bark of a Tree where part of the Juyce flows,
and the reſt forms a ſort of Subſtance Analogous to the <hi>Callus</hi>
in Bones, and ſo makes Reparation of what is loſt. In Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child the
<hi>Callus</hi> is not ſo ſoon formed, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons, becauſe a
great part of the Nutritious Juyce is employ'd in perfecting of the
<hi>Foetus,</hi> and in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatever the Age, Conſtitution, Diet,
Seaſon of the year, Climate, Ability, and Care of the Surgeon, have a great
ſhare.</p>
                  <p>There is a vulgar Miſtake, that the Bones are fuller of
Marrow at ſome certain times of the Moon, than at others, but Mr.
<hi>Rohault</hi> has irrefragably confuted this, and plainly ſhewn that at
all times of the Moon whetever, there is a plenty of Marrow in the Bones of
ſome, and very little in others; and that the Deficience do's ariſe from a
want of Nouriſhment or great Fatigue. He has obſerved that there is but
little Marrow to be found in the Bones of Sheep, which come from the remote
Provinces to <hi>Paris,</hi> and on the contrary, that there is a great deal to
be found in thoſe which have repoſed themſelves for a long time, and have
been well fed before they are killed. There is another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake 
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42110:199"/>likewiſe which prevails amongſt ſome ſort of
People, who think Fiſhes are fatter and leaner at one time of the Moon than
another; for whatever be the time of the Moon, ſome Fiſh will be lean and
others fat. The leanneſs of Fiſh very often proceeds from Tempeſts, or
their going too far up Rivers; for ordinarily they are found very fat near the
Sea, and very lean at a great Diſtance from it. Fiſhes taken near
<hi>Calais</hi> moſt commonly are lean, becauſe the Sea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts is for
the moſt part very rough, and all Fiſhes waſt very much if they are kept
for any time in Nets.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Bones may be diſtinguiſhed into four ſorts of
parts, the hardeſt which compoſes the Body of it, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which
ariſe from it, and are continuous with it, the <hi>Epiphyſes</hi> or
Appendages which are little additional Bones contiguous to it, and the
ſeveral Protuberances which jet out in any part of it. The
<hi>Epihhyſes</hi> are but external Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dittaments, and in young Bodies may
eaſily be ſeparated from the Main Bone, and there appears a Line which
divides the one from the other, which after diſappears gradually, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
as the Infant grows up, till both together appear one continuous Bone.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Proceſſes ſerve for the Articulation of the
Bones, and the Inſertion of the Tendons, Muſcles and Ligaments, and have
different Names impoſed on them, according to their different Figures: For
inſtance, if the extremity be round it is called its Head, if it
inſenſibly grow larger, its Neck, if long and ſharp pointed,
<hi>Corone;</hi> if the Heads be little and flat <hi>Condyli.</hi> The
Proceſſes of the Bones again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive different Names from their Figure,
and ſometimes are called <hi>Styloides, Ancyroides, Coracoides, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Cavities of the Bones which ſerve for the Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Joynts, if they are Superficial are called <hi>Glene,</hi> if large
<hi>Cotyle,</hi> and the ſmall Cavities ſormed for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a
Tendon are called <hi>Sinus,</hi> and the Holes through which the Veſſels
paſs, Sciſſures. When the bottom of a Cavity is large, and its entry
narrow, it is likewiſe called a <hi>Sinus,</hi> and a Cup or Cavity if it has
a large Mouth and Bottom, and in the laſt place a Hole, if it paſſes

                  <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> viz.
<hi>Sutura, Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Gomphoſis.</hi> When two Bones enter into
each other Indenturewiſe, this is called a Suture, in which manner the Bones
of the Skull are united; but when there is a Line only, it is called
<hi>Harmonia,</hi> and by this way the Bones of the upper Jaw are joyned. When
a Bone enters into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a Nail into a Hole, this is called
<hi>Gomphoſis.</hi> In the laſt place, when a Bone is flat and ſhelves
down by degrees, this is called a Squammous or Scale-like Suture, and in this
manner the Temple-Bone is joyned to the Parietal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Symphyſis</hi> is not ſo properly a <hi>Species</hi>
of Articulation, as the Coalition of two or more Bones, which become one
continuous Body. This is either without any middle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Body, as in the
tender Bones of young Children, or with ſome <hi>Medium</hi> which in harder
Bones unites the Parts together. This <hi>Medium</hi> is either ſome Fleſhy
Subſtance, and then it is called <hi>Syſſarcoſis,</hi> or ſome
Cartilage, and then it is named <hi>Synchondroſis,</hi> or ſome Ligament,
and then it is termed <hi>Syncuroſis.</hi> The two pieces of the lower Jaw in
Children, are united by <hi>Synchondroſis,</hi> and the Shoulder Blade and
the <hi>Os Hyoides</hi> by <hi>Syſſarcoſis,</hi> tho' to ſpeak properly
indeed, the Bones of the lower Jaw are not ſo much joyned by a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage, as
part of them remains Cartilaginous, and do's not Oſſifie ſo ſoon as the
reſt, and the Conjunction by Fleſh is really none at all, particularly in
the inſtances mentioned, the Superiour extremity of the <hi>Hyoides</hi> is
bound to the Styloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idal Proceſſes, and the Shoulder Blade to the Clavicle
by Ligaments, the Muſcles only ſerving for its Motion.</p>
                  <p>The Heads of all Bones are covered with a ſmooth,
ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery Cartilage, and in the Cavity of the Joynts, there is a Mucilaginous
Liquour which ſerves to lubricate them, and help their Motion. Add to all
this, that the Ligaments are exceeding pliant.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LVII.</hi> Of Fractures in general.</head>
               <p>A Fracture is <hi>a Diviſion of a Bone, whereby the continuity
is deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Fractures always proceed from ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Cauſe, as ſome Blow, Fall, or other Accident.</p>
               <p>Fractures are Compleat or Incompleat, Simple or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate.</p>
               <p>Compleat Fractures are ſuch where the Bone is entirely broke,
and Incompleat, where it is broke in part only, ſuch Fractures as are
accompanied with Wounds, are called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate.</p>
               <p>The Ancients reckoned up five manners, after which a Bone might
be broke, and impos'd ſo many <hi>Greek</hi> Names of Fractures. The firſt
where the Bone is broke directly a croſs, and this may be called a
Tranſverſe Fracture. The ſecond, when there is a Fiſſure lengthways.
The third, when the Bone was round at the end. The fourth, when the Bone was
broke in ſeveral pieces. The fifth, when a Shiver was wholly ſeparated.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS that a Bone is broke, are the Crack which the Patient
and the Standers by hear, a Depreſſion in the place of the Fracture, a
privation of Motion in the Part, and a craſhing of the Bones upon touching
them. Laſtly, the Part gives way when it is preſt and is crookt. If the
Bones ride one over another the part is contracted, and there is a Swelling and
Pain in the place where the Head of the Bone is. This is occaſioned by the
tearing of the <hi>Perioſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and the Compreſſion of the Marrow.
About three or four days after the Bone is reduced, there ariſes an
Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation very like an <hi>Eriſypelas,</hi> which ſometimes is ſimple
and only ſeated in the Skin on the Fracture, and ſometimes is attended with
<hi>Rigors,</hi> and a Violent Heat. This <hi>Eriſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas</hi> ariſes from
a Laceration of the Nervous, Tendinous, and Membranous parts, eſpecially in
Cacochymick Bodies. Sometimes Splinters of the Bones prick the Fleſh, and
cauſe a Violent Feaver; and thus much for Tranſverſe Fractures which are
ever moſt eaſie to cure when they are ſimple, and moſt difficult and
dangerous when they are complicated with ſome Wound.</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:42110:200"/>
               <p>The Fiſſure of a Bone is more difficult to diſcover, than
a compleat Tranſverſe Fracture, eſpecially if it be ſmall; For the
better finding out of theſe Fractures, you muſt try the part well as you
would a cleft ſtick, to ſee if you can diſcover any inequality in it; you
muſt ask the Patient if in falling he could hear the Bone crack, if the
ſwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſoon after, and he could perceive any thing fall down
gradually.</p>
               <p>If a Fiſſure be taken in time, there is no difficulty in
cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, but if it be neglected, or unskillfully managed, and a Carioſity
enſue, it is very dangerous, and cannot be cured without Amputation of the
Limb. Fractures where the Bones do much recede from their Natural place, are
more difficult to cure than others.</p>
               <p>If the Fractured Bone be broke into ſhivers and bits, the
Accident is more dangerous, becauſe there is a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion and
Laceration of the Membranous parts which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an Abſceſs. When there
are two Bones in a part and only one is Fractured, the danger is much leſs
than if both were broke; becauſe the Bone which is entire ſupports the
other, and preſerves the Natural Figure of the part, and there is not ſo
great an Extenſion neceſſary for the reſtoring it.</p>
               <p>Fractures in the middle of any Bone are not ſo dangerous, as
when they are near the Joynt, becauſe it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to reduce and
keep it in its place, by reaſon of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Tendons and Nerves which are
apt to cauſe a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of bad Accidents.</p>
               <p>Fractures in the ſoft Parts if there be no Wound or
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, are not difficult to be cured, but if there be, there is danger
of Pain, Inflammation, Convulſion, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a Gangrene.</p>
               <p>The Re-union of Bones is more ſpeedy or ſlow, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as
they are larger or leſſer, more porous or compact. Small Bones are moſt
commonly united in 25 Days, and the larger ones not under 40 or 50 Days. The
Thigh Bone is more difficultly united and requires a longer time, becauſe its
Muſcles are large and thick, and it is very apt to fall out, and to
aſſume an ill Figure, and is rarely ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but that the
Patient remains a Cripple.</p>
               <p>If the Reduction of a Bone be deferred too long it is ever
difficult, becauſe the Juyces which circulate through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fibres being
concreted about the Extremities of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Oſſifie, and
ſtopping the Pores, hinder a ſupply of Matter for the forming a
<hi>Callus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:42110:201"/>
               <p>The Bones are for the moſt part more brittle in Winter, than
at any other time, becauſe the Exceſſive cold conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Pores
and hinders the ſupply of that Oyly Marrow, which humects and makes them
ſupple; and for the ſame Reaſon, there is a more ſpeedy Coalition in
young, than in old Bodies, becauſe the Paſſages are more open for the
diſtribution of that Unctuous Medullary Subſtance.</p>
               <p>The Bones in Big-bellied Women are not united without great
Difficulty, the Reaſon of which ſeems to be, that a great part of the
Nutritious Juyce in the Mothers Body, is employed in the ſervice of the
<hi>Foetus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Oblique Fractures, the parts of the Bone are retained in
their place with leſs trouble than in Tranſverſe, becauſe they help to
ſupport each other.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>The Surgeons buſineſs in Fractures is only to bring the
two ends of the Bone together, and retain them there, and in the mean time to
prevent all Accidents which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; but the cure it ſelf, and the
forming of a <hi>Callus</hi> for the Re-uniting the divided Bone, is the Work
of Nature. For the Succeſsful doing this, the Artiſt muſt have all
Neceſſaries provided, all his Dreſſings in a Readineſs, and ſome
Perſons by to aſſiſt him. The Part muſt be kept in a ſtrait
Situation, and the Hands which hold the Limb muſt be placed as near the
Fracture as may be, and not above the next Joynt, which would be very
inconvenient. For inſtance, if the Bone be a Leg and that be broke in the
midſt, the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants muſt not take hold of the Foot, and the Thigh
in order to make the Attraction, but muſt lay their Hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Foot,
and below the Knee. If both ends of the Bone are together, there is not
required ſo great an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, as when one Bone rides on the other,
however it is neceſſary to make ſome ſort of Extenſion to prevent the
breaking off ſome Aſperities by the ends, rubbing againſt each other.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Aſſiſtants keep the Part extended, the
Artiſt muſt make all Even and Level with the Palm of his Hand, preſſing
the Fracture all around, and paſs his Thumb all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long it to try if it be
equal in all parts, for then he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it is well reduced. If he
perceive any Splinter of the Bone to pierce the Fleſh, he muſt make an
Inciſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, and then if it do not Re-unite, it will come away in
the Suppuration.</p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:42110:201"/>
                  <p>If there be a Fracture in the Great Bones, and they are not
reduced at firſt, the Hands are not ſufficient alone to perform it, but the
Artiſt muſt uſe Machines, eſpecially if the Parts of the Bone ride on
one another, and the Muſcles be very ſtrong; but he muſt be careful not
to make too ſtrong Extenſions for fear of breaking the Veſſels, and
tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tendons from the Bones.</p>
                  <p>The Signs which demonſtrate a Part to be well reduced, are a
Ceſſation of Pain, the recovery of its Natural Figure, it appearing in the
ſame manner as when ſound, which is to be attentively conſidered at each
Dreſſing, particularly at firſt; becauſe the part newly reduced may
very eaſily be drawn out of its place by the Patients turning himſelf in
his Bed, or ſome other Convulſive Motion of the Muſcles.</p>
                  <p>When the Bone is reſtored make ſome proper Bandage, all
which ſhall be deſcribed in their proper places.</p>
                  <p>When there is a Fiſſure only let the Part be bound
ſtrait, that ſo the Fracture may reunite. When there is a large, ſoft,
Tumour on the Fiſſure which ſeems to be filled with Blood collected
there, or a certain Liquour which exudes out of the Bone, it muſt be opened
to give vent to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour contained in it, and the Orifice kept open with a
Tent, and treated in the ſame manner as a Complicate Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and the Bone
and Wound healed together.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. The Bandage muſt not be too ſtrait, for fear
leaſt the extraordinary Compreſſion intercept the influx of the Blood and
Spirits, and the part Gangrene and come away; on the other Hand care muſt be
taken that the Bandage be ſtrait enough to keep both ends of the Bone
together, that they may not fall aſunder, upon the leaſt ſtirring the
Body. The Bandage may be concluded to be well made, if there be a ſmall
Tumour at the extremities, and the Patient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ſenſible of a ſlight
Pain, and if there be no riſing, and the Patient feel no Pain, the Bandage
muſt be undone, and the Part bound ſtraiter.</p>
                  <p>It is beſt to forbear all Cataplaſms, for theſe only
ſtop the Pores and hinder Tranſpiration. There muſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> be too many Splints, nor
theſe be bound too tight together, but there muſt be at leaſt a Fingers
breadth between them, to avoid the Pain which may ariſe from too great a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; you muſt begin to tie theſe firſt in the middle, and
then above, and laſtly below.</p>
                  <p>The moſt proper time of undoing the Bandage is to be
determined by the Accidents, for inſtance; When the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent 
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42110:202"/>is in very great pain, or the Bandage is looſe take it
off. Parts which have little Fleſh, will endure Bandage lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Carnous
parts. If there be a great itching in the Part, the Bandage ought to be taken
off, for fear of an Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſypelas or Excoriation.</p>
                  <p>If there appear any Veſications on the Part when the Bandage
is taken off, they muſt be opened to let out the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the part
fomented with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> or a Solution of
<hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> or <hi>Salt of Lead,</hi> or a Decoction of <hi>Sage,
Camomil, Melilot, Roſes,</hi> and a little <hi>Camphire</hi> in
<hi>White-wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If no Accident happen leave the Bandage as long on as may be,
taking care that it do not grow looſe.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. When the Bone is reduced, care muſt be taken to
take off the Inflammation by the uſe of proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as Embrocating the
fractured part with a ſimple Tincture of <hi>Flowers of St. Johns wort</hi>
in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> or the compound made by adding a third part of
<hi>Earth-worms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Part be contuſed, chafe it with a Mixture of
<hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which is an excellent Medicine to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> and appeaſe all Symptoms. Inunctions
with <hi>Oyl of St. Johns wort,</hi> and Fomentations made with a Decoction of
<hi>Roſemary</hi> in Wine, and a Liniment of <hi>Oyl of Earthworms</hi> and
<hi>Turpentine,</hi> is very good. The following Catagmatick Emplaſter is
excellent. ℞. <hi>Fine white Roſin</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr> 
                     <hi>Common
Turpentine,</hi> ℥iij. Melt and incorporate theſe with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of
<hi>Meadow-ſweet, Biſtort, Round Birthwort,</hi> till they are of the
conſiſtence of an Emplaſter, adding a little diſtilled <hi>Oyl of
Humane Bones,</hi> or to better the Compoſition, put in Extract of <hi>Round
Birth-wort,</hi> or melt in Powder of <hi>Amber</hi> or <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam of
Peru</hi> when you uſe it. This Emplaſter is to be uſed after the Bone
begins to re-unite. The two ends of this Emplaſter muſt not be laid over
one another, but a ſmall Interval muſt be left between, and a Liniment made
of <hi>Oyl of Earthworms</hi> acuated with the Chymical <hi>Oyl of
Roſemary</hi> us'd outwardly.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, all inward and outward Means muſt be made
uſe of. The <hi>Lapis Oſteocollae</hi> in <hi>Comfrey Water</hi> is a good
Specifick, but it is not convenient to continue the uſe of it too long a
time, for fear it breed too large a <hi>Callus. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus's</hi> Powder is very
good. ℞. <hi>Oſleocolla</hi> prepared, ℥i. <hi>Choice Cinnamon,

                  <p>The Fracture muſt be unbound the third or fourth day, to
ſee in what condition it is, and then muſt be bathed with Simple Water, or
a Decoction of the Vulnerary Plants. The Bandage muſt not be too looſe nor
too ſtrait, for if it ſhould be too ſtrait, it would hinder the Influx of
the Blood and Spirits, and endanger a Gangrene. It is beſt to lay no
Cataplaſms on the Part, however if it be inſiſted on, lay on <hi>Herb
Robert</hi> pounded, or Powder of <hi>Biſtort</hi> infuſed in Wine, having
firſt well rubbed the Part with <hi>Oyl of St. Johns wort</hi> to help the
Re-union, and prevent an Inflammation; but a Cataplaſm is better than
this.</p>
                  <p>In Fractures eſpecially where there is a Contuſion, if the
Nerves, Ligaments, Tendons, or any like parts happen to be contorted or
diſlocated, <hi>Foreſtus's</hi> Cerate may be applied, which is thus made.

               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Reducing of the Bones to their
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Situation and Figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of this Fracture is always ſome External Accident,
as ſome violent Blow or Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which demonſtrate that there is a Fracture of the
Bones, are a Depreſſion, and diſtortion of Noſe which makes a
diſagreeable Figure.</p>
               <p>If the Part be not reduced it is ſoon filled with
<hi>Ozena's</hi> or ſtinking Ulcers, and incurable Polypous Excreſcences,
the Party cannot breath through it, and loſes his Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>The Noſe is compos'd of its two proper Bones, and the <hi>Os
Cribroſum</hi> and <hi>Vomer.</hi> The two proper Bones are two ſmall Bones
pretty ſolid, and almoſt of a ſquare Figure pretty ſmooth without, but
not quite ſo much within. They are joyned by a Suture in the place where they
meet with the Bones of the Forehead and the upper Jaw, and theſe two Bones
form the bridge of the Noſe, and it is theſe which are Fractured and
Diſlocated by violent blows. As for the <hi>Os Cribroſum</hi> or
<hi>Ethmoides,</hi> that is deſcribed in the enumeration of the Bones of the
Skull, in the Chapter of the Trepan, the <hi>Vomer</hi> receives its Name from
its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to a Plow-ſhare; in its lower part it has a Cavity, in
which a ſmall Proceſs from the Sphaenoidal Bone is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. This Bone
is very minute, and in its upper has a ſmall Channel in which the Tongue of
the Bony Partition of the <hi>Ethmoides</hi> is enchaſed. The <hi>Septum
Nar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um</hi> or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of
the Noſtrils is formed of theſe two Bones, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons muſt have a
great care not to hurt this when they apply Cauſticks to conſume Polypous
Excreſcences of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>The lower and inmoſt part of the Noſe is formed by a Plane
made of a Portion of the Bones of the upper Jaw, and thoſe of the Palate. The
ſmall Bones of the Palate are very thin, and for that Reaſon very apt to
cariate in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Diſtemper, which if it happens, makes the party
ſnuffle or ſpeak in the Noſe. The way to remedy this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, 
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42110:204"/>is to ſtop that Hole with a thin Plate of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which has a Ring in the midſt to put a bit of Spunge into, which is to go
into the Hole of the Roof of the Mouth. For this Spunge imbibing all the
Humidities of the Mouth, cauſes the Silver Plate to apply it ſelf againſt
the Roof of the Mouth, that it cannot be drawn out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deal of
Pain. This Plate may be called the <hi>Obturator</hi> of the Palate. There is a
Cartilage faſtned to the end of the Bones of the Noſe, which makes the tip
of the Noſe capable of Motion.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Place the Patient in a convenient Poſture, and then taking a
ſtick cut it ſlat and ſmooth, and wrapping it round with Cotton,
introduce it with the right Hand into the Noſe to raiſe up the Fractured
Bones which are depreſſed, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to lay the Thumb of the left Hand
on the Fractured Bone, that ſo raiſing it on the inſide, you may bring it
to its Natural Figure; and when you have reduced one ſide, you may do the
ſame on the other, if there be occaſion.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When the Bones are reduced, put a Leaden Pipe up
the Noſtrils to keep them in their due Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. This Pipe muſt be made
flat, and of a Figure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodated to the Part, that ſo there may be no
danger of hurting it. Before theſe Pipes be put up into the Noſe, they
ought to be anointed with <hi>Balſam</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> or <hi>Oyl of
Turpentine</hi> mixt with Spirit or Wine, and to have two Ears or Rings on each
ſide, that ſo they may be tied to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Night-cap with Ribbons.
When the Pipe is put up into the Noſe, lay two ſmall Triangular
Compreſſes along on each ſide of the Noſe, and lay a Paſt-board of
the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure on the Compreſſes.</p>
                  <p>If there be a Wound which can very hardly happen, lay proper
Medicines onto procure a good Digeſtion, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no poſſibility of

Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Paſt-board, keeping them on with a Sling or Fillet with ſour
Tails. To apply this, take the two upper Tails with the Thumbs and Fore-fingers
of each Hand, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the plain undivided part on the Noſe, and bring the
two upper Tails behind the Head, and back again on the firſt turn, and pin
them where they end, then take up the two lower Tails, and bringing them over
the Head, pin them in <pb n="377" facs="tcp:42110:204"/>the ſame manner as the firſt,
and this is a general Rule in the applying all divided Fillets.</p>
                  <p>There is another Bandage ſometimes uſed when the Noſe is
concerned, which is called the <hi>Foſſa</hi> of <hi>Amyntas.</hi> This is
made with a Roller an inch and an half broad, and two Ells in length rolled up
at both ends; you muſt begin to apply this behind on the top of the Head, and
bringing the two ends of the Roller before, croſs them on the Noſe, and
ſo bring them behind on the Nape of the Neck, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain over the
firſt turn, croſſing on the Noſe, continuing in this manner; and in the
laſt place, making ſeveral Circular Turns on the Forehead, to ſix theſe
where they end. In making this Bandage, you muſt take care not to compreſs
the Part too much, it ſufficing if it be ſtrait enough to keep the
Applications on the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>There is a third Bandage which is ſometimes made uſe of in
Fractures of the Noſe, which is called <hi>Accipiter</hi> or Hawk. To make
this, take a Rag and cut it into the ſhape of a Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, which may be large
enough to cover all the Dreſſings on the Noſe, and ſtitch a narrow
Fillet about a quarter of an Ell in length, and three quarters of an inch broad
to the upper Angle of this Triangle, and lay this Fillet over the Sagittal
Suture, and let it hang down behind; then ſtitch two more to its lower
ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> to each Angle, and bringing them over the Cheeks, tie
them to that which paſt over the Sagittal Suture; beſides theſe ſtitch
two to the bottom of the Triangle, which muſt be two Ells in length, and more
than of an inch broad, and croſs theſe two under the Noſtrils, riſing
obliquely on the Cheeks to the ſide of the leſſer Angle of the Eye. and
ſo making a X behind the Head, bring them forward again, and croſs them on
the Noſe; then bring the two ends round the Fore-head and pin them. This
Triangle muſt have two Holes in the place of the Noſtrils for
Breathing.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Dreſs the Part at leaſt once a day in the ſame
manner as all contus'd Wounds, forbearing to draw the Pipes out of the Noſe
till the Bones be conſolidated, and confining the Patient to a good Diet.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXVII.</hi> Of the Fracture of the lower
Jaw.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is the <hi>Reduction of the Fractured Bones, to
their proper Situation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Fractures in this part frequently are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by Blows and Falls.</p>
               <p>Children till the Age of 7 years or thereabouts, have their
lower Jaw compos'd of two Bones divided by a Cartilage, which in proceſs of
time is entirely Oſſified. The Bone of the lower Jaw is very hard and
ſmooth and externally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex reſembling the Letter U. The Mandible or
lower Jaw has four Holes, two Internal ones which are the largeſt, and two
External ones which pierce its <hi>Baſis,</hi> through each of the Internal
Holes there paſſes a Rope compos'd of a Vein, an Artery, and a Nerve, the
Nerve is a Ramification of the fifth Pair, and the Veins and Arteries of the
Jugulars and Carotids. The Branches of the Nerves go out through the External
Holes, and are ſpent on the Skin and Muſcles of the Lips. All theſe
Veſſels are diſpenſed to the Roots of the Teeth of the lower Jaw, and
carry Nouriſhment to them. The Bone of the lower Jaw has ſeveral
Protuberances to which Muſcles are affixed, theſe Extremities are flat and
large. The lower Jaw has on each ſide two Proceſſes, the one called
<hi>Condylus,</hi> and the other <hi>Corone.</hi> The firſt ſerves for the
Articulation, and has its Head arm'd with a Cartilage, and is received into a
Cavity of the <hi>O' Petroſum,</hi> which is likewiſe armed with another
Cartilage, which ſerves to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate their Motion. This Arriculation is
covered with a Ligament, the <hi>Corone</hi> is ſlender and acuminated, and
into this the Tendon of the Temporal Muſcle is inſerted. All Blows on this
Muſcle are dangerous, and attended with bad Symptoms, it being covered with
the Tendinous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Frontal, and other contiguous Muſcles, and not with the
<hi>Perioſteum</hi> as is vulgarly, but erroneouſly thought.</p>
               <p>In the Cavities of the Mandible the Matter is contained, out of
which the Teeth are formed, and there are the Sockets in which they are
ſet.</p>

                  <head>Of the lower Jaw in the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The lower Jaw begins to Oſſifie in the ſecond Month, and
is compos'd of two Bones joyned together below the Noſe, and jetting a great
way out. In the third Month the Jaw is compos'd of four Bones, <hi>viz.</hi>
two large ones joyned at the Chin, and two leſſer ones which form the
<hi>Corone,</hi> and theſe two Bones are joyned together by a thin
tranſparent Membrane.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth Month, it appears all
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the lower Jaw, as well as the upper of thoſe
ſmall Protuberances, which are more apparent in the <hi>Foetus</hi> than in
Adults.</p>
                  <p>The inequalities are the Cells in which the Teeth are ſet,
or at leaſt where they are firſt formed, and they leſſen in proportion
to the growth of the Jaw. The Holes in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the lower Jaw through
which the Veſſels which go to the Teeth paſs, are inviſible in a
<hi>Foetus</hi> of four Months old, but they are viſible in the ſeventh
Month, as well as the external Holes which penetrate the Bone.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the Bones of the Jaw ride over one another, ſome of the
Aſſiſtants muſt put his Fingers into the Patients Mouth, and make a
ſlight Extenſion whilſt the Surgeon preſſes the Extremities both
within and without.</p>
                  <p>If the Teeth are looſe put them into their Natural place,
where they will ſoon ſix again if they be tied with a Silver Wire or a
waxed Thread to thoſe Teeth which ſtand firm. The moſt certain way to
find whether the Teeth are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is by comparing the Teeth of the lower Jaw
with thoſe in the upper, to obſerve if they anſwer exactly, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Grinders to the Grinders, the Eye-teeth to the Eye-teeth, and the
Fore-teeth to the Fore-teeth.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay on the Jaw a Compreſs of a competent
length, and made of Raggs ſeveral times doubled, and dipt in ſome
Defenſatives, and then cover this with a Paſt-board of a Figure not unlike
the Jaw, and make the Bandage called the <hi>Capiſtrum</hi> or Bridle. To
make this, take a Roller of two Ells long, and an inch and a half broad, and
begin with a circular turn round the Head, then paſs under the Chin and
riſe on the Cheek, paſſing near the leſſer <pb n="380" facs="tcp:42110:206"/>Angle of the Eye; then go obliquely behind the Head on the oppoſite
Cheek and under the Chin, and reaſcend on the firſt turn of the Roller,
making an Edging on the fractured Jaw, then continue to proceed round
paſſing behind the Head.</p>
                  <p>Take a Roller rolled up ar one end, which muſt be three Ells
in length, and about an Inch and a half broad, and begin with making a Circular
turn round the Forehead; then paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chin and reaſcend on the
Cheek paſſing near the leſſer Angle of the Eye, then turn obliquely
behind the Head, and deſcend on the oppoſite Cheek paſs under the Chin,
and reaſcend on the firſt turn of the Roller, leaving an edging on the
Fractured Jaw, then proceed round paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing behind the Head, over the Cheek,
under the Chin, and make an edging on the Fracture, then reaſcend on the
Cheek, paſs behind the Head, over the oppoſite Cheek, under the Chin, and
make a third edging on the Fracture; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcend and proceed over the
firſt Turn, paſs behind the Head, bring the Roller over the Chin, and make
two Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Turns there, and finiſh the whole by making two Circular Turns
with the remaining part of the Roller round the Forehead and Head, and in the
laſt place pin the ends. In making this Bandage obſerve to make edgings on
the Fracture, and in all the other parts to bring the Roller directly over the
neather Turns.</p>
                  <p>If the Jaw be broke on both ſides, reduce it in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
above deſcribed; and lay a Compreſs with a Hole in middle on it, to put the
end of the Chin through, and ſo apply each end on the ſides of the Jaw
reſpectively, over theſe ſtitch a Paſt-board of a Figure adapted to the
Jaw, and perforated in the midſt likewiſe, and keep theſe on with the
double <hi>Capiſtrum</hi> or Bridle, which is made in the following
manner.</p>
                  <p>Take a Roller five Ells long and an Inch and a half broad.
apply this to the Chin, and bring each end of the Roller over the Cheeks, and
make an X on the top of the Head, then paſs it behind, and return on each
ſide under the Chin and paſs over the Fractures, making an edging on each;
then reaſcend circularly over the ſame turns of the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and make an X
on the Head, deſcend under the Chin and make edgings on the Fractures, then
reaſcend over the Head, paſs behind, deſcend and paſs over the Chin,
then reaſcend on the Cheeks and paſs over the Head, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and
bring the two ends of the Roller twice over the <pb n="381" facs="tcp:42110:206"/>Chin,
making Circular Turns there, then bring them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Head and ſo round
the Forehead to keep the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turns ſteddy, and pin it where it ends.</p>
                  <p>But before I leave this Subject, I ſhall deſcribe another
Bandage us'd in Hurts of the Chin in Children, which tho' it do not properly
concern Fractures of the Jaw; yet can no where be better inſerted than here,
it being my Deſign to give the Reader Inſtructions in all the ſeveral
manners of Dreſſing and making Bandages which can be required in a Courſe
of Operations.</p>
                  <p>Take a Roller ſix Ells long, and more than two Inches broad
rolled up at both ends, and apply the middle of it on the Forehead, and pin it
there to the Night-Cap, then bring the two Heads behind the Patients Head,
croſs them there, and ſo bring them under the Patients Arm-pits, then bring
them before and paſs them behind the Head, and croſs them again, and bring
them over the Forehead, behind the Head, and croſs them, next bring them
under the Arm-pits, and having firſt made two or three turns about the
Breaſt, pin the ends.</p>
                  <p>In burns of the Face, make a Mask of Linnen Cloth, and having
ſmear it with ſome proper Liniment, tie it behind the Head with
Ribbons.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient lie on his Back for fear leaſt the
Bones ſhould be diſplaced by his lying on one ſide, and during the Cure,
let his Diet be liquid and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</p>
                  <p>The lower Jaw is moſt commonly re-united in twenty Days.</p>

leaſt it make too large a <hi>Callus,</hi> and the Part become Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
and Deformed, as he relates it once hapned to him in a Fracture of the Thigh. A
dram of this Stone is given to the Patient in a Morning faſting, being finely
levigated in a Marble Mortar with <hi>Comfrey Water,</hi> but the Surgeon
muſt from time to time look to ſee that the <hi>Callus</hi> do not
encreaſe more than is convenient, and forbear any longer uſing it when he
finds this.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Callus</hi> happens to grow ſo large as to make

Collar-Bone.</head>
               <p>THE Operation is <hi>the Reducing the Bone to its Natural
place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE is moſt commonly ſome Blow or Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. If the Clavicle be compleatly broke a croſs, that
end which is ſixed to the <hi>Acromion</hi> together with the whole
Shoulder-blade ſinks, which is cauſed by the Weight of the Arm.</p>
               <p>If there be any Splinters, a pricking and ſharp pain may be
perceived; but if the <hi>Fiſſure</hi> be lengthways, it muſt of
neceſſity become thicker, which may be ſoon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by comparing it
with the ſound Clavicle. The Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are two Bones which very much
reſemble an <hi>Italian ſ,</hi> and are placed in the upper Part of the
<hi>Sternum.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Surface of theſe Bones is extremely ſmooth
and polite, but their inner ſubſtance is ſpungy and porous, which is the
Reaſon why they re-unite ſo ſoon when they are once fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whilſt
on the other Hand they are very much expos'd to <pb n="383" facs="tcp:42110:207"/>Accidents, and ſoon broken, having nothing beſides the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to protect them. At the ends of theſe Bones there are two Proceſſes, one
of which is Articulated to the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and the other to the
<hi>Acromion</hi> of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> and their principal uſe is to keep
the Shoulder-blades in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Situation.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Clavicles of the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>There are no Bones in a <hi>Foetus</hi> which are ſooner
Oſſified, than the Clavicles which are entirely Bony, within ſix Weeks
after Conception. Nature ſeems to contrive this for the defending the Heart,
to preſerve it from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by the <hi>Sternum</hi> and
<hi>Scapulae,</hi> which continue Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous for a long time.</p>
                  <p>The Clavicles are the largeſt and moſt ſolid Bones of
the whole Body, till a <hi>Foetus</hi> arrives at the third Month, and Age only
adds largeneſs and ſtrength to theſe Bones, their Figure being altogether
the ſame as in Adults.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the Clavicle be broken, aſunder an Extenſion muſt be
made. For this purpoſe place the Patient on a Stool without a back, and draw
back the Arm which is on the ſame ſide with the Fracture, and let an
Aſſiſtant ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind and puſh the Shoulder up, whilſt another
draws the Arm back: While this Extenſion is making reduce the Bones, by
thruſting back that end of the Bone which is above, and drawing that below,
ſo that both may exactly meet, and you may diſcover that they do ſo by
feeling with the Thumb all along the Bone.</p>
                  <p>There is another way of making an Extenſion of the Clavicle,
which is thus; put a Tennis Ball wrapt up in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth, and preſs the
Patients Elbow cloſe to his Side. This makes an Extenſion of the Clavicle,
to the end the Bone may be reduced with more facility.</p>
                  <p>Or let the Patient lie on his Back on a Quilt laid on the
Floor, and lay ſome convex Body under him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Shoulders, and let
both his Shoulders be thruſt down, that ſo the two ends of the Bone may be
ſtretcht as far under as may be, and the Surgeon have an opportunity of
reducing the Bone in the mean time.</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:42110:208"/>
                  <p>If there be any Splinters which run into the Fleſh, mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> an Inciſion into the place
which is pained, and lay the Bone bare to reduce the Splinters, and cut off the
Aſperities which prick the Fleſh, with Pincers.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When the Bone is reduced, fill the Cavities
above and below with Compreſſes of a length and figure ſuitable to the
Bone, and over theſe Compreſſes lay others of the ſame Figure; let each
Compreſs be ſtitched to a Paſtboard of the ſame Figure with
themſelves, and keep theſe Dreſſings on with the Bandage called the
<hi>Cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi> This is made with a Roller ſix Ells in length, and three
Inches broad rolled up at one end, the middle of this is applied on the
Clavicle, then bring one end on the Breaſt, and to keep that ſteddy, bring
the other end obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely behind the back, and ſo under the ſound Arm, and
again forwards over the Breaſt, to fix that which hangs down over the
Breaſt, and when this is done, bring it over the Clavicle and ſo behind the
Back, and keep it ſteddy there; then bring the other end under the Arm
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, to fix that Head which paſſes behind; and when this is fixed,
bring it again over the fractured Clavicle, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every time it
paſſes over the Clavicle, to leave an edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the laſt place,
continue to make Circumvolutions with the Roller about the Body, paſſing
one Head under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and carrying up the other end over the Clavicle,
till it be quite covered with the edgings; and when the Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is cover'd,
make ſeveral Circular turns round the upper part of the Arm, leaving a
ſpace called the Cranes Bill, which at length muſt be covered by continuing
the edgings on it with the two ends of the Roller, which in the laſt place
muſt be circulated around the Breaſt, and then pin'd at the ends.</p>
                  <p>If the Clavicle be broke near the Shoulder, you muſt make
the Bandage called the <hi>Spica,</hi> which the Reader will find deſcribed
in the Chapter of the Luxation of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient lie on his Back, for if he ſhould
lie on one Side, there would be danger of the Bones falling out of its place.
He may eat roaſted Meats or any thing which is eaſie of Digeſtion, and
there is no neceſſity of Abſtinence, or being confined to a ſpare Diet,
unleſs there be a Feaver or Inflammation. This Bone moſt commonly is united
in 20 Days.</p>

there is a great <hi>Stupor</hi> which proceeds from the Nerves diſpenſed
to the Muſcles of that part.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scapulae</hi> or Shoulder-blades are large flat Bones
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the Back, one on each ſide, and have the Figure of a Scalenous
Triangle, each Bone is concave on the inſide, and convex without, and has two
ſides and Angles, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and the other below, on the back-ſide is a
long Ridge which is called the <hi>Spine,</hi> the parts adjacent to this, are
called the <hi>Supra Scapulium,</hi> that above, and the <hi>Infra
Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> that which lies beneath the Spine. The large end of the Spine
where it is crooked, is called its <hi>Acromion,</hi> and that ſide which is
next the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> is called its <hi>Baſis.</hi> This has two
Angles, the one above, and the other below. In the <hi>Scapula</hi> there is a
Cavity to receive the Head of the Shoulder-bone, and over this there is a
crooked Proceſs, which has the Name of <hi>Coracoides</hi> given to it, from
its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Ravens Bill. All the ſide below which bounds 
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42110:209"/>the <hi>Scapula,</hi> is called its lower ſide, and the
other are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led its Borders or Edges.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scapula</hi> is faſtned to the Clavicle by ſeveral
Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Cavity which receives the Head of the Bone, is almoſt
entirely formed by Ligaments which ariſe from the edge of the Cavity, and
encompaſs the <hi>Acromion</hi> and <hi>Coracoidal</hi> Proceſs; and this
is the reaſon why the Arm is ſo ſubject to Luxations, it having nothing
more than Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to keep it in its place, which with a very little
ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be forced out of its place.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the <hi>Scapulae</hi> is to defend the Ribs, help
the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulation of the Clavicles with the Bones of the Arm, and for the
Riſe and Inſertion of Muſcles.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If any Fragments of Bones are broke off, and thruſt out
without pricking the Fleſh, put them into their place with the Palm of the
Hand, or the Thumb. But if they have any points and prick the Fleſh, make an
Inciſion and ſnip off the Jagged end with a pair of Pincers, and reduce the
Bone into its right place if it adhere to the <hi>Scapula,</hi> but if it be
looſe take it off.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay a Compreſs dipt in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſative
Liquors on it, and a Paſt-board over that, both of which ought to be as large
as the Shoulder-blade, and to have the ſame Figure, and then keep all on with
the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage commonly called the Star. This is made with a Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler four or five
Ells in length rolled up at one end; apply the Extremity of the Roller behind
the Back under the oppoſite Arm-pit, then bring it under the other Arm-pit,
and over the Shoulder, that ſo it may make an X on the middle of the Back,
then bring it under the other Arm-pit, and laſtly over that, ſo it may
paſs behind the Back and make another X leaving an Edging, and ſo bring it
ſeveral times over the Back, ſtill leaving an Edging till both the
Shoulder-blades are covered, and then finiſh the Bandage by making ſeveral
Circular turns round the Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If there be a contus'd Wound on the
<hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi> you muſt digeſt and deterge the Wound, dreſſing it
twice a Day in the uſual manner; but if it be a ſimple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, it
muſt be united as ſoon as may be, and requires no more than ſome
Deſenſative to be applied on it.</p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:42110:209"/>

continues to be Membranous till the third Month, and then its Oſſification
begins with a little white ſpot in the Center, which expands it ſelf by
degrees. The Place of the Articulation of the <hi>Scapula</hi> to the
Shoulder-bone terminates in an Angle, in the midſt of which there is a white
Line which extends a little farther. This Line is the firſt beginning of the
Oſſification of the Shoulder-bone.</p>
                  <p>The Spine on the Body of the <hi>Scapula</hi> is boney in the
fourth Month, but the <hi>Acromion</hi> continues to be Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous at that

                  <p>This lower Angle is more remote from the Center of

                  <hi>CHAP. LX.</hi> Of the Fracture of the Ribs.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>Reducing the Ribs when they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
to their Natural Situation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of a Fracture of the Ribs, is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſome
Blow or Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. When a Rib is entirely broke, the ends ſometimes
thruſt into the Breaſt, and at other times continue in their Natural place.
If a Rib thruſts in it compreſſes and tears the <hi>Pleura</hi> and the
Lungs ſometimes, and this creates a great Pain, and a conſtant pricking of
the Part, the Patient cannot breath without great Pain and Difficulty, ſpits
Blood, and a Feaver is kindled.</p>
               <p>If the Fractured ends thruſt out, there is a ſenſible
riſing, but if the two ends of the Bone continue together, none of the above
mentioned Symptoms appear, and there is only a Craſhing that can be
perceived, in thruſting the Ribs with the Thumb.</p>
               <p>The Ribs are placed on each ſide the Spine, and may well
enough be compared to Segments of a Circle. Near the <hi>Sternum</hi> they are
flat and large, and grow round in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their diſtance, approaching
to the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi> They are Articulated with the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> by
two Productions, one of which is covered with a Cartilage, and implanted into
the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and the other is joyned to the Tranſverſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of
the ſame <hi>Vertebra</hi> on the ſame ſide.</p>
               <p>The Exterior Surface of the Ribs is rought and unequal, the
Interior is ſmooth and equal. In their lower part they have a finall Channel
for the Reception of the Nerve and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal Artery with a Branch of the
<hi>Vena Azygos,</hi> and the Surgeon muſt avoid cutting theſe Veſſels
in the perforating the Breaſt in making the Operation in an
<hi>Empyema.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ribs are entirely bony, but their Extremities toward the
<hi>Sternum</hi> are Cartilaginous, for the better facilitating Reſpiration.
They are fixed to the <hi>Sternum</hi> by their Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, which ſometimes
become bony, eſpecially in Women. The Number of the Ribs is not always alike
no more than the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> ſometimes there has been found thirteen,
more rarely eleven, but the moſt common Number is twelve. Of 
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42110:210"/>theſe, ſeven are called true Ribs, and five falſe
or Baſtard Ribs.</p>
               <p>The true Ribs are placed in the uppermoſt part of the
Breaſt, and are fixed to the <hi>Sternum.</hi> The Baſtard Ribs are ſo
called, becauſe they are ſhort, ſoft, and are not implanted into the
<hi>Sternum,</hi> but adhere by the Cartilages to each other. The Baſtard
Ribs leave a void place before, to make room for the Motion of the Stomach. The
loweſt of the Baſtard Ribs is the ſhorteſt of all, and does not adhere
like the reſt, but ſometimes is found adhering to the Diaphragm, as well as
the eleventh Rib.</p>
               <p>All the Ribs are unequal in length and breadth. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rib
is ſhort, flat, and more large and crooked than any of the reſt. The middle
are longer and larger than the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the inferiour are near upon the
Matter of the ſame length as the upper, but not of the ſame breadth.</p>
               <p>The Ribs make an Arch, which contains the Heart, Lungs, and
other Organs of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and beſides they ſerve to give a
Riſe and Termination to ſeveral Muſcles of the <hi>Thorax.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Ribs in the <hi>Foetus.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The firſt and laſt Ribs in a <hi>Foetus</hi> of two Months
old are Membranous, and the other are Bony. About the ſame time the
Sciſſure through which the Intercoſtal Artery, Vein, and Nerve paſs,
begin to appear. The Ribs begin to Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie very early, which is ſo
ordered by the Providence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the better defending the Heart,
Lungs, and other <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> which ſeem to
want ſome ſuch Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to protect them, and give them liberty to grow and
exert their reſpective Functions. For the two firſt Months the Ribs are not
Articulated with the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> but are only planted to Cartilage,
which after becomes the Tranſverſe proceſs of the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third Month, as if Nature were aſhamed of her lazy
proceeding, on a ſudden ſhe Oſſifies the upper Rib which becomes as
hard, large, and ſolid, as thoſe which were Oſſified in the ſecond
Month. About this time the laſt begins likewiſe to Oſſifie, which
nevertheleſs continues to be Cartilaginous till the fifth Month, but this
ſeldom happens. The Ribs continue to encreaſe and grow hard from the ninth
Month, till the Birth.</p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:42110:211"/>
                  <p>In a <hi>Foetus</hi> the Ribs are crookt, and like ſo many
Arches form a Vault, which is the Cavity of the Breaſt, beſides this there
is another Curvature which is peculiar to the <hi>Foetus,</hi> the ſix upper
Ribs being crookt at the Extremity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the middle. Theſe
Curvatures are not ſenſible in Adults, and gradually diſappear as the
Animal grows.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the Rib which is hurt thruſt out, place the Patient in a
Chair, and let an Aſſiſtant ſtand by to hold him; then bid the Patient
bend his Body on the ſide oppoſite to the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and keep cloſe his
Mouth and Noſe, and hold his Breath to dilate his Breaſt, this Dilatation
ſerving in ſtead of an Extenſion, in the mean time thruſt the two ends
of the Bone together and reduce it. If one end of the Bone enter the Breaſt,
make an Inciſion and take it out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ambroſe Parrè</hi> propoſes this way,
<hi>viz.</hi> to lay the Patient on the ſound ſide, and apply an
Emplaſter of <hi>Maſtich</hi> on the Fracture, and then to pull it off with
Violence, that ſo the Rib be drawn up with it; and by repeating this
Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he pretends to raiſe the ends which were depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>Some Practitioners apply Cupping-glaſſes on theſe
Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, pretending to draw up the Bone by the help of the Fleſh, which
tumefies and riſes up into the Glaſs, but both theſe Ways are
ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay a ſingle Compreſs dipt in ſome
Defenſative on the fractured part, and lay two other Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudinal
Compreſſes over it, which muſt croſs each other Salterwiſe; then
ſtitch two Paſt-boards of the ſame Figure with themſelves, to the two
laſt Compreſſes, and lay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large Linen Compreſs with an oblong
Paſt-board, and cover this again with a Compreſs; in the laſt place keep
all on with the Bandage called the <hi>Quadriga.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make this, take a Roller five Ells long and three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
broad rolled up at both ends, and apply the middle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pit, and make
an X on the Shoulder, then bring each end of the Roller over the Breaſt, and
over the Back, ſo as to croſs under the Arm-pit and make another X on the
Shoulder; then bring again the two ends of the Roller one over the Back, and
the other over the Breaſt, ſo as to make an X before and behind, and leave
edgings on the Breaſt with both ends of the Roller deſcending till it be 
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42110:211"/>covered, and then fix it by a Circular turn round the
Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of Bandage may be made with a Napkin
ſupported by the Scapulary, according to the Method deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the
Operation of the <hi>Empyema.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE CURE. <hi>Fab. Hildanus</hi> gives us the following
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Proceſs in the Cure of an Accident of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A
certain Perſon having broke two of his Ribs near the Spine, the ends of the
fractured Bones thruſt out which he reduced, and after Embrocated the Part
with <hi>Oyl of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> next he applied a Cataplaſm made of <hi>Flower
of Barley, Powder of Roſes, Balauſtiums, Cypreſs Nuts, Galls,
Tormentil</hi> and one whole Egg, and then laid on Compreſſes, Splints,
made the neceſſary Bandages not too ſtrait, and within a little time all
the Accidents ceaſed. As ſoon as the Ribs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, he gave the
Patient a Decoction of <hi>Self-heal</hi> and <hi>Water-creaſes,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. and
confined him to a good Diet, the next Day he bled him, taking off the
Dreſſings, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give him the forementioned Draught twice a

Breaſt-bone.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>a Reducing the Bones of the</hi> Sternum
<hi>into their proper Situation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of the Fracture is ordinarily ſome Fall or Blow
received,</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS which demonſtrate the <hi>Sternum</hi> to be
fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, are a Depreſſion of the Part, a Palpitation of the Heart, a
Difficulty of Breathing, <hi>Delirium,</hi> and often times a ſpitting of
blood. Theſe Symptoms proceed from a Compreſſion of the
<hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> Heart, Lungs, Nerves, and other Veſſels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sternum</hi> makes up the fore part of the Breaſt, and
is placed in the middle between the Ribs and the Breaſt, the forepart of
which it compoſes. It is of a porous Subſtance, and all of one piece in
Adults, but made up of diverſe ones in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as we ſhall
ſee hereafter. It is a little forked in its upper part where it has a
<hi>Sinus</hi> on each ſide to receive the Head of the Clavicle, which is
Articulated with a Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage intervening. In its inner ſide there is a
<hi>Sinus</hi> to give paſſage to the <hi>Aſpera Arteria.</hi> The
<hi>Sternum</hi> ends in a point, and throughout its whole length has lateral
<hi>Sinus's</hi> which receive the Cartilages of the Ribs. At its lower
Extremity it has a Cartilage fixed into a ſmall Cavity of the
<hi>Sternum,</hi> and this is called <hi>Xiphoides,</hi> from its reſembling
a Dagger. It is ſometimes Triangular, and at other times it is forked, and
ſometimes it is almoſt round; ſometimes its point turns in, and when this
happens it compreſſes the Stomach, and occaſions Vomiting ſometimes it
is perforated, for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit of ſome Veins which go to the Breaſt.
This Cartilage in ſome Bodies has been found to extend to the Navil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sternum</hi> ſerves as a Rampart to the Heart, and
helps to ſupport the Breaſt and Ribs.</p>

                  <p>This is Cartilaginous till the fourth Month, and very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or never bony. The Number of bones in the <hi>Sternum</hi> of Children is not
certain; ſometimes it is compos'd of ſeven, <pb n="393" facs="tcp:42110:212"/>and
ſometimes eight. Sometimes there is but four in a <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of nine

bones only.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixth Month the <hi>Sternum</hi> is compos'd of four
or five bones, and ſometimes there is no more than one. Some <hi>Foetus</hi>
of ſix Months have the <hi>Sternum</hi> Cartilaginous. In the eighth Month it
is compos'd of four or five bones. In ſhort, it is impoſſible to
determine any thing certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Number and Situation of the bones
of the Breaſt; ſometimes the lower bones are larger than the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ones,

                  <p>Let the Patient be laid on a Quilt on the Ground, and place
ſome convex Body under him between his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and let ſome Servant
preſs on the ſides of the Breaſt, which puſh out, that by this
Extenſion the bones may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into their Natural Situation; or if this
prove ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, make an Inciſion and ſay the Fractured bone bare, that
ſo you may raiſe it with the <hi>Terebellum</hi> or Screw. This muſt be
exquiſitely ſharp, that it may enter the bone upon touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the
lighteſt manner imaginable; for if it were quite depreſt, it would
infallibly kill the Patient.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay a Triangular Compreſs wetted in Wine
heated, and over that another thick Triangular Compreſs ſtitcht to a
Paſt-board of the ſame Figure, and let the point of this be applied
downwards; in the laſt place, keep the Dreſſings on with a Napkin folded
in two or three pleats, ſuſpended with the Collar in the ſame manner as
was directed in the Chapter of the <hi>Empyema,</hi> or you may uſe the
<hi>Quadriga,</hi> deſcribed in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient lie on his Back, for if he ſhould

               <p>THE SIGNS. When the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the back are
fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, the Arm becomes Paralytick, and loſes both Senſe and Motion,
the Patients Excrements come away invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and ſometimes a
Suppreſſion of Urine enſues.</p>
               <p>The Fracture of the Body of the <hi>Vetebrae</hi> is dangerous,
becauſe the Spinal Marrow which is the Origin of the Nerves is hurt upon
theſe occaſions. The Fracture of the Spinal Proceſſes is not ſo
dangerous, as that of the Body of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> becauſe the
<hi>Medulla</hi> is not hurt by it.</p>
               <p>The whole number of <hi>Vertebrae</hi> make up one long Column
of bones from the Articulation of the Head to the Rump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, and all this
<hi>Compages</hi> is called the Spine, which name is given it from ſeveral
pointed bones.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> derive their Name a <hi>Vertendo,</hi>
becauſe the whole body is turned to and fro upon them.</p>
               <p>The Spine has a Curvature inwards from the firſt
<hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> of the Neck to the ſeventh, and then is convex out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
from the firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the back to the twelfth, to enlarge the
capacity of the Breaſt; then again it is as a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vature inwards from the
firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Loins to the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> which is
compos'd of ſeveral <hi>Vertebrae</hi> united together, and ſerves to
enlarge the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Women who are formed by
Nature for the bearing of Children.</p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:42110:213"/>
               <p>The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> mutually receive, and are received by
each other, which <hi>Species</hi> of Articulation is called
<hi>Ginglymos,</hi> and are bound to one another by Ligaments and Cartilages.
There are for the moſt part ſeven <hi>Vertebrae</hi> in the Neck, twelve in
the Back, and five in the Loins; and the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> is compos'd of
ſeveral <hi>Vertebrae</hi> more, all which form but one bone in Adults, which
as the Child grows up leſſens, and ends in a point.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are bound together by a ſtrong
Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Ligament. This Ligament hinders them from grating againſt each
other, and by its flexibility yields to their Motion every way. The Spine is
bended, extended, and turned round every ways. The whole Spine has a large Hole
from the top to the bottom, to give paſſage to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and in the
Juncture of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> on each ſide they form a Hole for the
Tranſmitting Nerves from the Marrow.</p>
               <p>Each <hi>Vertebra</hi> is compos'd of its body, and three
ſorts of Productions or Proceſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Oblique, of which
there are two Superiour, and two Inferiour, the Tranſverſe to which the
Muſcles are fixed, and the third or Spinal ſeated behind in the midſt of
theſe which are very ſolid, and give a Denomination to the whole Column.
Beſides theſe, there are five <hi>Epiphyſes</hi> or Appendages to each
<hi>Vertebra,</hi> two of which make the two edges of the <hi>Vertebra,</hi>
two of Tranſverſe Proceſſes, and one of the Spinal ones.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have a long Neck, moſt commonly have eight
<hi>Vertebrae</hi> in it, and but eleven in the Neck, which leſſening the
Cavity of the Thorax, makes ſuch Perſons Phthiſical, on the contrary, in
ſhort Necks there is often but ſix <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and ſuch are
ſubject to Apoplexies. The Tranſverſe proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are perforated for
the Tranſmitting Veins and Arteries, and have their ends forkt for the
implanting of Muſcles. The Tranſverſe proceſſes are likewiſe
forked, ſhort, and a little inclined.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck is called
<hi>Atlas,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and ſupports the Head on two ſmall
<hi>Sinus's</hi> lin'd with Cartilages. This <hi>Vertebra</hi> has no Spines,
leaſt it ſhould hurt the two ſmall Muſcles called <hi>Obliqui
Inferiores,</hi> when the Head is bound forwards. It has on its inner part a
ſmall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Cavity, which receives the Tooth-like Proceſs of the
ſecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck. At the lower part of the two Superiour
Cavities, there are two ſmall round Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from whence a Ligament like a
Cord iſſues, which ſtrongly binds the Tooth-like Proceſs. The firſt
<hi>Vertebra</hi> has <pb n="396" facs="tcp:42110:214"/>no more than ſix Proceſſes,
but on its foreſide it has a ſmall Eminence which may be eſteemed a
ſeventh.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Vertebra</hi> is call'd <hi>Dental</hi> from
its Tooth-like Proceſs which enters into the firſt. <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
aſſures us, that the anteriour Luxation of this <hi>Vertebra,</hi> cauſes
an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Quinſie. This is likewiſe call'd the <hi>Axis,</hi> becauſe
its Tooth-like Proceſs ſerves as an <hi>Axis</hi> to the firſt
<hi>Vertebra.</hi> The Superiour Oblique Proceſſes of this, are received
into the Cavities of the firſt, and on this are made all the Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
the Head. The third <hi>Vertebra</hi> is not ſo tall as the ſecond, and its
Spinal Proceſs is ſhorter. The fourth and fifth <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the
Neck, have their Spinal Proceſſes more inclined than the firſt. The body
of the ſeventh is larger than any of the Superiour, and its Spinal Proceſs
is long and roundiſh at the end, and is very like the Proceſs of the
firſt <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Back.</p>
               <p>The twelve <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, are larger than
thoſe of the Neck, but are not quite ſo ſolid, and are perforated by
ſeveral Holes for the paſſage of Veſſels. The firſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Criſta,</hi> becauſe it reſembles the Creſt of a Helmet, which is
not unlike that of a Cock. The ſecond is called <hi>Axillar is,</hi>
becauſe it lies near the Arm-pits, the eight lower are called
<hi>Coſtales,</hi> becauſe the Ribs are implanted to them. The
Tranſverſe Proceſſes of the Back, are large, ſolid, round, at the
Extremity, and a little crookt above. In each Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Proceſs there
is a ſmall Cavity, and another, on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Body of the
<hi>Vertebra,</hi> to receive the two ſmall Condyls of the Ribs. The twelfth
<hi>Vertebra</hi> differs in many reſpects; its Oblique Proceſſes are
roundiſh both above and below, in ſuch a manner, that it is received by
both Ribs for the ſmall Heads of the Oblique Proceſſes, enter the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Superiour <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and there is no Tranſverſe Proceſs
on the twelfth <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and the Motion of the Back is much freer on
this twelfth <hi>Vertebra,</hi> than on any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſometimes there
are thirteen, and ſometimes fourteen <hi>Vertebrae</hi> in the back of large
Men, but moſt commonly eight, and very ſeldom eleven.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns.</head>
                  <p>Moſt commonly there are five <hi>Vertebrae</hi> in the
Loyns, and ſometimes tho' ſeldom, there are ſix. The firſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Renalis</hi> from its Vicinity to the Kidneys. The <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi> of
the Loyns are more large and porous than thoſe of <pb n="397" facs="tcp:42110:214"/>the
Back. Their Tranſverſe Proceſſes are ſtrait, long, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and
parallel, reſembling ſo many ſmall Ribs. Their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Proceſſes are
ſtrait, flat, large, and roundiſh at the end. The Motion of the Trunk is
principally made on the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loins. And ſince their
Tranſverſe and Spinal Proceſſes are parallel, they cannot compreſs or
grate againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; on the contrary, there is but a ſmall ſpace
between the Tranſverſe Proceſſes of the Back, and their Spinal
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are inclined to, and touch each other exactly.</p>

               <p>THE CAUSE of a Fracture in this part, is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſome
Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS of a Fracture of the Rump, are a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of
the Excrements, a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> of the Sphincter which proceeds from the
<hi>Coccyx</hi> being depreſt by a Fall, and compreſſing the
<hi>Rectum</hi> and its Sphincter, to which add the Extremity of the Pain.</p>
               <p>The Rump-bone is placed at the Extremity of the <hi>Os
Sacrum,</hi> and is compos'd of four or five ſmall bones, and two Cartilages
joyned together, which form a ſort of a Tail crookt inwards. The firſt Bone
of the Rump which joyns to the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> is the largeſt, and has two
ſmall Tranſverſe Proceſſes, and two more above them.</p>
               <p>The Rump-bone keeps up the <hi>Rectum.</hi> This part often
endures great pain in Womens Labour, becauſe the Child thruſts it very much
back in the Birth.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To reduce a Fracture of the Rump-bone, put the forefin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of
the right Hand up into the <hi>Anus,</hi> having firſt pared the Nail very

the help of both Fingers, put the Bone into its place. But obſerve here, that
this Bone for the moſt part is rather luxated than fractured.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Put ſome Body in form of a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory into

                  </p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient lie on his ſide till the bone be

Shoulder-bone.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>a Reſtoring that Bone to its
properplace.</hi> THE CAUSE of the Fracture moſt commonly is ſome Fall or
Blow.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The Fracture of the Shoulder-bone, may be perceived
by a craſhing of the Bone, in moving up and down the Arm, and if the ends of
the Bones do not meet, the Arm is diſtorted, appears ſhorter than the
other, and the Patient endures a great deal of Pain.</p>
               <p>The firſt Bone of the Arm is called the <hi>Humerus</hi> or
Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone, and is ſolid, long, and unequal, and has a Head in its upper
Extremity, which is cover'd with a Cartilage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the
<hi>Sinus</hi> of the Head of the Shoulder-blade. This Bone has two
Productions, the Exteriour of which is ſmall and arm'd with a Cartilage, and
receives the <hi>Radius</hi> or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Focil, the Inferiour has two
<hi>Sinus,</hi> and reſembles a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with which the Elbow or greater Focil
is Articulated, and there is a ſmall <hi>Fiſſure</hi> on the fore-part of
the larger Head of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> through which one head of the
<hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus Biceps</hi> paſſes, as a Rope on a Pully.</p>

                  <head>Of the Bones of the Hand, or lower part of the Arm.</head>
                  <p>Theſe Bones are two in number, the <hi>Cubit</hi> and the
<hi>Radius.</hi> The <hi>Cubit</hi> or greater Focil is articulated with the
<hi>Humerus,</hi> and has a large Proceſs on that ſide, in the midſt of
which are two Cavities with an Eminence between them, which forms a ſort of
<hi>Ginglymus.</hi> The poſteriour Proceſs at the Head of the
<hi>Cubit</hi> is termed <hi>Olecranon,</hi> and on this it is that a Man
reſts when he leans on his Elbow. The lower end of the <hi>Cubit</hi> is
round and ſlender, and has a ſmall protuberance from whence ſeveral
Ligaments ariſe.</p>
                  <p>The Cubit has two ſorts of Motions, <hi>viz.</hi> Flexion
and Extenſion, and has one protuberance and two Cavities, for the Reception
of the two protuberances of the Shoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. The jetting out of the Cubit is
received in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Shoulder-bone, on which it turns after the
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Pully.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Radius</hi> accompanies the CuBit but ends before it
and is Triangular through its whole length. It has a ſmall' round Head in its
upper part, at the end of which there is a Cavity for receiving the Bones of
the <hi>Carpus,</hi> and on this the Motion of the Wriſt is made. Beſides
this, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſmall Cavity which turns on the inferiour
protuberance of the Cubit. When the <hi>Radius</hi> is turned inwards the Hand
is directed by it, and this is termed Pronation; and when it is moved outward,
the back of the Hand is turned down, and this is called Supination. The Cubit
is thick in its up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part, and ſlender towards its lower; the
<hi>Radius</hi> on the contrary is more ſlender above, and thicker below. The
Cubit receives the <hi>Radius</hi> above in a ſmall Cavity, on which the
<hi>Radius</hi> is turned round, and below the <hi>Radius</hi> receives the
Cubit. Theſe two Bones touch at their extremity, and leave a ſpace all
along their middle, in which there is a a Membranous Ligament which connects
one Bone to the other.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond Month theſe Bones are entirely
Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, having only three white ſtreaks in the middle of them. The
uppermoſt, which is the beginning of the <hi>Hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> is the longeſt,

is more ſolid than their extremities.</p>
                  <p>About the third Month the upper and lower Bones of the Arm are
articulated together, and the Cubit and <hi>Radius</hi> which cohered before,
begin to ſeparate in their midſt, and continue to touch only at their
Extremity. About the ſeventh or eighth Month, the ſmall Protuberances and
<hi>Epiphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are not diſcernible, but ſhortly after in the ninth
Month, they becomes as viſible as they are in the Bones of Adult Perſons.
The <hi>Humerus</hi> in the <hi>Foetus</hi> is ſtrait, round, and long, but
in Adults it is ſomething bent.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Place the Patient on a Stool, or let him ſit in his Bed, and
let one Aſſiſtant take hold of his Arm above the Elbow with both Hands,
and another ſtand behind and take hold of the upper part of it with both
Hands, and let both of them draw together; and at the ſame time let the
Surgeon bring the two ends of the Bone together, and adjuſt them by
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the part around with the palm of his Hand, till he finds there
is no inequality.</p>
                  <p>If after the Fracture the two ends of the Bones continue
together, yet a ſlight Extenſion is neceſſary, for fear leaſt the
Surgeon break off any of the <hi>Aſperities</hi> at the end in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them to a Level. After the Bones are reduced, let the Aſſiſtants continue
to hold the Arm, extending it a little till the Dreſſing be made.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING is made with a ſimple Compreſs dipt in ſome
Defenſatives to prevent the Inflammation from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it ſelf to the
part. When this is laid on take a Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler above two Inches broad and two Ells
in leghth, rolled up at one end, and with this make two circular turns about
the Fracture, and bind the part ſtrait enough to keep the Bones in their
proper place; then bring up the Roller a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending lengthways of the Arm with
little edgings, which muſt not be altogether ſo ſtrait as the turns about
the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and when the Roller is ſpent, pin it at the upper end of the
Arm. When this is done, take another Roller of the ſame breadth and length
with the former, and begin to apply it on the Fracture, making three Circular
turns about pretty ſtrait; but in this the turns of the Roller muſt be made
to reduce thoſe Muſcles which the firſt turn had drawn a little aſide,
then bring down the Roller to the bottom of <pb n="406" facs="tcp:42110:219"/>the Arm
leaving ſmall Edgings, and bring it over the Flexure of the Elbow, but not
ſo as to bind the Joynt, them bring it up again leaving little Edgings, and
pin it where it ends. After this, you muſt have four longitudinal
Compreſſes of a competent thickneſs, and almoſt as long as the Part
which is hurt, and each of theſe muſt be covered with a Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, or a
very thin Splint made of a very thin Deal; in the next place take a Roller as
before, but ſomething lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and apply this near the Elbow, and make three
Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar turns about the Fractured part, and ſo bring the Roller up to the
top of the Arm, ſtill leaving Edgings; next bring it under the Arm-pit and
about the Body; and ſo faſten it. Beſides this, you may if you pleaſe
lay on two Paſt-boards of an equal length with the Part, and encompaſs the
Arm with theſe, and tie them with three Ribbons, beginning with that in the
midſt; and in the laſt place, ſuſpend the Arm with a Sling.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If the Patient keep his Bed which is moſt
adviſeable for him to do, it will be ſufficient to repoſe his Arm half
bent on a Pillow, without uſing any Sling at all. If it be not a complicate
Fracture, the beſt way is to keep the Bandage on as long as may be; nay, not
to undoe it at all till the cure be compleated, except ſome Accidents, as
Pain, Inflammation, or Itching ſhall require it, or it ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of it
ſelf, and indeed the leſs any Bones are ſtirred, the ſooner they will
unite. However the Patients Arm muſt be moved toand fro on the Joynt, for
fear leaſt the Bones ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together, and the part loſe its Motion.</p>
                  <p>During the Cure, let the Patient be fed with Nouriſhing
Meats, ſuch as roaſted Fleſh.</p>

Natural place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Fractures in this Part moſt commonly are
occaſioned by ſome Blow or Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Fractures of this part are diſcovered by the
Deformity, and by the craſhing of the Bones when they are ſtirred.</p>
               <p>The Hand is compos'd of the <hi>Carpus</hi> or Wriſt,
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacarpus</hi> and the Fingers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Carpus</hi> or Wriſt is made of ſmall Bones
diſpos'd in two Ranks, each of which conſiſts of four Bones. All theſe
Bones are bound together by ſtrong Ligaments, and have a polite ſlippery
Cartilage on them. The firſt Range of Bones jet out, and are received into
the Cavity of the <hi>Radius,</hi> and on this Articulation all the Motions of
the Wriſt are made. The ſmall Bones of the Wriſt are even without, and
uneven on the inner ſide.</p>
               <p>The four Bones of the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> are long, ſlender,
and unequal in their length, they have Proceſſes above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and
touch at their Extremities, leaving Spaces in the middle, which are filled by
the <hi>Muſculi interoſſei.</hi> Theſe Bones are convex and ſmooth in
the Palm of the Hand, and are ſomething concave inwardly, and ſomething of
a a triangular Figure, they are ſtraitly bound to the ſecond range of the
Bones of the Wriſt, and ſeem to make but one Bone with them. In there upper
part they are articulated with the ſmall Heads of the firſt Range of Bones
of the Fingers.</p>
               <p>The five Fingers are each compos'd of three Bones which are
convex, and ſomething hollow in the middle for the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the
Sheath-like Ligament, through which the Tendons <pb n="408" facs="tcp:42110:220"/>of the
Flexors of the Hand paſs. The firſt Range of Bones in the Fingers, are
articulated with the Bones of the <hi>Metacar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> by <hi>Arthrodia.</hi>
The Bones of the Fingers are articulated by <hi>Ginglymus,</hi> and are fifteen

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To make the Extention, let one Aſſiſtant hold the
Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Arm above the Wriſt, and another by the Fingers, and whilſt both
draw it, take care to reduce the Bones into their place.</p>
                  <p>If the Fingers only are broke, reduce them ſeparately one
after another.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. If the Bones of the <hi>Carpus</hi> or
<hi>Meta-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> only are broke, lay a Compreſs dipt in ſome
Defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on the Fracture, and another pretty thick Compreſs in the
Hand, making the Bandage called the <hi>Half Gantlet.</hi> To make this, take a
Roller of four or five Ells long, and an Inch and a half broad rolled up at one
end; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to apply it on the Wriſt, making three Circular turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; then bring the Fillet to the <hi>Metacarpus</hi> aſcending ſpirally,
next bring it obliquely over the Hand, and then between the Thumb and
Fore-finger, and ſo into the Hand, and then over it and make it croſs on
the firſt turn, then make a Circular turn about the Wriſt, and bring it
again over the Hand leaving an Edging; next make a turn round the Wriſt, and
bring it over the Hand leaving an Edging, and proceed in this manner till the
Hand be quite covered by the Edgings; then lay on a Compreſs ſtitcht to a
Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board on the Back of the Hand, and another on the inſide, both which
muſt be of a Figure adapted to the part. Theſe Paſt-boards muſt be kept
on with the Head of the Roller, by covering them in the ſame manner as the
Hand, and when this is done, bring the Filler ſpirally up the whole Arm
leaving ſmall Edgings, and pin it above the Elbow, forbearing to cover that
with the Circumvolations, as was noted in the Chapter of the Fracture of the
Arm.</p>
                  <p>If the Fingers are Fractured each of them requires a
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bandage, and muſt be bound ſtrait almoſt in the ſame manner
as the Arm.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If there be no Wound, keep the Dreſſings on till
the re-union be made, unleſs ſome accident require them to be removed, but
if there be any, dreſs it after the manner practiſed in Contuſions.</p>

Bones to their Natural place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of the Fracture is ſome Blow or Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. When a Fracture is near the Head of the Bone, it is
very difficult to know it, and it is eaſily miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Luxation; and
for this reaſon not being reduced, the Patient continues lame all his
Life-time; but if the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be in its middle and the ends do not meet,
there is a viſible Deformity and inequality, and the Patient cannot ſtand
or ſtir his Thigh, and it is ſhorter than the other. When the ends of the
Bones meet, a craſhing may be heard.</p>
               <p>There is but one Bone in the Thigh, which is ſomething convex
before and curve behind, and the Artiſt muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this
curvature, becauſe if the Bone ſhould be ſet, ſtreight, it would be
longer than naturally it ought to be and the Patient would become lame.</p>
               <p>This Bone has a large round Head, covered with a ſmooth,
ſlippery, Cartilage. This is received into the <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> and has a
round Neck ſomething inclined. At the end in the Center of this Head, there
is a Ligament which is fixed to the Center of the <hi>Acetabulum.</hi> Beneath
on the hinder part of the Neck there are two Proceſſes, which from the
uſe they have in the Rotation of the Thigh-bone, are called
<hi>Trochanthers;</hi> the upper of theſe is larger and ſomething
ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and is termed the greater, and the lower the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; beſides
theſe on the hinder part, there is a long Proceſs for the Implantation of
divers Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The lower part of the Thigh-bone is larger, and has two
<hi>Condyli</hi> which are a little curve on the inſide. Theſe
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances are roundiſh at the end, and are covered with a large,
ſmooth, Cartilage; there is a Proceſs between theſe two, and a large
Cavity which receives the Protuberance of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and makes a
ſort of Hinge. At the bottom of the Thigh on the fore-part there is a ſmall
Cavity, into which the <hi>Rotula</hi> is fixed. The Thigh-bone in the
<hi>Foetus</hi> continues Cartilaginous the ſecond Month.</p>

                  <p>If the Fracture be near the Head of the Bone, there is no room
to take hold of it, and therefore a Napkin muſt be put between the Patients
Thighs, and one Aſſiſtant muſt draw this, whilſt the other takes hold
of the Thigh a little above the Knee, and ſo makes the Extenſion. If this
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conveniently enough done with the Hands, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon muſt make
uſe of Girths, or if theſe be not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, of Towels.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Wrap the Fracture round with a large ſimple
Compreſs dipt in Wine heated, and lay a good Compreſs three quarters of an
Inch thick all along the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low part of the Thigh to preſerve its Curvature;
for if it were ſtreight, it would be longer than it ought to be, and the
Patient would be lame all his Life-time.</p>
                  <p>The Bandage muſt be made with three Rollers about three
inches broad, rolled up at one end. The firſt Roller muſt be three Ells in
length, and the ſecond four. The way of applying the firſt Roller is thus;
Firſt make three Circular turns about the Fracture, then bring it up the
Thigh ſpirally, leaving ſmall Edgings, and faſten it round the Body; when
this is done, apply the ſecond Roller on the Fracture and make two Circular
turns, and bring it down the Thigh ſpirally leaving ſmall Edgings, and ſo
continue (without covering the Knee) to deſcend all along the Leg, and bring
the Roller under the Foot like a Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, and reaſcend up the Leg leaving
ſmall Edgings, and pin it where it ends. If you pleaſe you may end below
the Knee without proceeding farther; when this is done, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a graduated
Compreſs at the bottom of the Thigh, to keep it equal all along. In the
laſt place, lay four longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Compreſſes round the Thigh, and let
each Compreſs be and Inch and a half broad, and almoſt as long as the Thigh
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42110:221"/>it ſelf, and cover each of theſe with a Paſt-board
or a Splint of Deal, which muſt be very thin and pliant, and keep theſe
Compreſſes on with the third and laſt Roller, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying which, you
muſt begin beneath and riſe up by ſmall Edgings, and ſo embrace the
Dreſſings together with two large Paſt-boards, which muſt be tyed with
Ribbons, and not lie over one another. You muſt put a ſmall Soal with a
Quilt under the Patients Leg to keep it right with the Toes up, and a ſmall
Roll of Linnen under the Heel, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not ſwoln; for in this caſe
there is no need of it, and in its ſtead with a Napkin folded in three
pleats, and rolled up at both ends, and lay this under the Leg to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the
Heel from being compreſt; let there be one Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon ſtitcht to the end of
the Bolſrer, and another on each ſide to ſupport the Foot, and tie
theſe to the Junks in which the Foot is laid.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are made in the following manner, take two ſticks as
long as the Patients Leg and Thigh, and wrap them in ſtraw tying it round
with a Ribbon, then Roll theſe two ſticks together with the Straw in which
they are wrapt in a Cloth, and lay the Leg and Thigh together with the
Dreſſings between them. Before you lay the Patients Thigh between the
Junks, lay three Ribbons over, and as many under the Leg, and place the Junks
on theſe. And obſerve here to make that Roll of Junks which lies on the
out-ſide, at leaſt three Inches longer than that on the inner; before you
tie the Junks, you muſt place a Bolſter on each ſide the lower part of
the Leggs, about the Ancles, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Leg near the Knee, in
the lower part of the Thigh above the Knee, and in the upper part of the Thigh
under the Groin, that ſo all the hollowneſs and inequalities may be filled
up, and the part may lie eaſily. Beſides theſe, lay a pretty thick
Compreſs lengthways on the Leggs and Thighs. When the Junks are thus rolled
up cloſe to the Leg and Thigh, begin to tie the Ribbon in the midſt, and
ſo proceed to the reſt. The knots muſt be made on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the
Junks, the Ribbon at the upper end of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low muſt be tyed to that next
the Knee, and the Ribbons which are on the ſide of the Pillow, muſt be
brought a croſs each other, and pinned to the Roll of Junks about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Leggs; when this is all done, place the Leg on a Pillow with the Foot a
little raiſed, and place a Cradle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to keep off the Bed-cloths.</p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:42110:222"/>
                  <p>In the Hoſpital of the <hi>Charite des Hommes,</hi> they
uſe Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es matted within, and by this means they pretend to keep the Leg
Stable and in a good poſture.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient lie on his Back, to keep the whole
Leg equally extended; and when there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of making the Patients
Bed, let two luſty fellows place their Arms under his Buttocks, and ſupport
his Body with their two other Hands, whilſt another puts both his Hands under
the Dreſſing to lift up his Leg and Thigh, and then carry him to Bed or
Table with a Quilt on it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him whilſt his bed is made.</p>
                  <p>If there be no Wound, keep the Dreſſings on as long as may
be without removing them, and feed the Patient with Meats eaſie of
Digeſtion, as Fowl, Roaſted Fleſh, and good Broths.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXVIII.</hi> Of the Fracture of the
<hi>Rotula.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Reduction of the Bones of the</hi>
Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula <hi>into their Natural place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of this Fracture is moſt commonly ſome Blow or
Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. This Fracture is diſcerned by a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the
parts of the Bone. If the Fracture be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the Muſcles
ſometimes draw the Fragment pretty high under the Teguments of the Thigh.
When this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, there is great reaſon to fear the Patient will continue
lame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rotula</hi> is a ſmall round Bone placed on the
Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Leg and Thigh, and is covered with a ſmooth Cartilage,
which diſpoſes it for Motion. It is a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex outwardly, and
articulated by <hi>Ginglymus,</hi> and covered with Ligaments, and the Tendons
of the Muſcles. This ſmall Bone ſerves as a Pully to the Tendons of the
Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which paſs over it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rotula</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb begins to
appear on the fourth Month, and continues Cartilaginous till after the
Birth.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the <hi>Rotula</hi> be fractured tranſverſly, the upper
part will be drawn up; and therefore to reduce it, place the Patient on his
Back, and let ſome Aſſiſtants extend the Leg, and then bring down the
Bone, and with your Thumbs adjuſt it to that which remains below, and here
obſerve never to take off both Thumbs together, for then the piece will
infallibly fly out of its place.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Rotula</hi> be fractured lengthways, there is no
need of making an Extenſion, becauſe the Bones do not ſtart far from one
another, and it ſuffices to thruſt them into their place, and then make the
Dreſſing.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. If the Fracture be Tranſverſe, the way of
Dreſſing it is in this manner; take a Roller of three Ells long, and about
an Inch and a half broad rolled up at <pb n="414" facs="tcp:42110:223"/>both ends, apply
the middle of this Roller above the <hi>Totu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and make two Circular
turns, then bring it down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ham and croſs it there, then bring it
beneath the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi> and make a Circular turn; next bring it up and
let it croſs again below the Knee, then bring it up and make a Circular turn
there, and continue thus bringing it up and down, and croſſing under the
Knee, and making Circular turns above and below, till the Joynt be covered with
the Edgings, and then pin the end of the Roller either above or below the Knee;
when this is done, lay the Leg in the Junks in the ſame manner as was
directed in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Rotula</hi> be fractured lengthways, take a Roller
of about three Ells long, and two Inches broad rolled up at both ends, and
having a ſlit in the midſt, apply the middle of this on the middle of the
Fracture, and paſs one of the Heads of the Roller through the ſlit in the
mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, ſo that this ſlit be in the middle of the <hi>Totula;</hi> then
draw the Roller pretty ſtrait to keep the parts of the Bone together, and
cover the <hi>Rotula</hi> with ſeveral Circumvoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leaving all along
ſmall Edgings; and laſtly, keep all ſteddy by ſeveral Circular turns
about the <hi>Rotula;</hi> and when this is done, lay the Leg in the Junks.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Embrocate the contiguous parts with good
Defenſatives, to prevent a Fluxion or Inflammation, and do not remove the
Bandage till the Cure be perfected, or it ſlacken of its own accord, or
ſome accident require it, and let the Patient feed on Roaſted Fleſh, or
Nouriſhing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids.</p>

place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of Fractures in this Part, are ſome Blow or
Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. There is a viſible Wound, the craſhing of the
Bones may be heard, and the Part is ſenſibly ſhorter than it ought to
be.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Tibia</hi> only be broke, the other ſupports it and
hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it from jetting out; but if both Bones are broke, they very often ride
on one another, and then the Leg is ſhorter than it ought to be.</p>
               <p>There are two Bones in the Leg, the <hi>Tibia</hi> or larger
Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the <hi>Fibula</hi> or leſſer. The <hi>Tibia</hi> forms the
fore-part of the Leg, and has a Protuberance at its upper end, which is
received into the Cavity of the Thigh-bone. Beſides theſe, there are two
long <hi>Sinus's</hi> which receive the Head of the Thigh-bone, which by
reaſon of the Cartilages which line them appear very long. <hi>M.
Sanguerdius</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved another <hi>Sinus</hi> in the fore-part lying
between the two former, which are ſeparated by a prominence, at the
Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of which, there ſprings a Ligament which is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the
Thigh-bone. This Bone is Triangular, and its anteriour part which is long and
ſharp, is called its Edge or Spine; at its lower end it has a Proceſs which
makes the internal Ancle; and in the laſt place, it is articulated with the
<hi>Aſtragalus</hi> by <hi>Ginglymus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fibula</hi> is much ſlender than the <hi>Tibia,</hi>
and is placed in a manner behind the Leg; it has a round Head at its up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
End, which terminates a little below the Head of <pb n="416" facs="tcp:42110:224"/>the
<hi>Tibia,</hi> but its lower end is extended below the <hi>Tibia.</hi> The
<hi>Fibula</hi> is bound to the <hi>Tibia</hi> by common Ligaments.</p>
               <p>The two Focils of the Leg ſpread from each other, and leave an
interſtice in the midſt, which is filled with a large looſe Ligament, and
ſome Muſcles which deſcend all along the Leg; and for this Reaſon in
Amputation of the Limb, it is uſual to divide theſe by a ſharp,
ſtreight Knife, to prevent the Accidents which might follow, if they were
left to be torn by the Teeth of the Saw.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tibia</hi> continues to be Cartilaginous on the ſecond
Month in the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and the <hi>Fibula</hi> do's not appear
diſtinctly at that time, but in the third Month they are bony and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
enough.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>Place the Patient on his Back, and let an Aſſiſtant take
hold of his Leg above the Foot, and another below the Knee; and if both Bones
are broke, and ride one over the other, let them make a ſtrong Extenſion,
which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be ſo great if one of the Bones remain entire, and
then with both Hands bring the Bones even.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When the Bones are reduced, dreſs this like
other contus'd Wounds, applying Pledgits with good Digeſtives, and laying on
an Emplaſter, and a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Compreſs over that wetted in Wine heated.
When the Wound is dreſt in this manner, bind up the part with the Eighteen
tail'd Bandage in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Take a large picce of Linnen Cloth as long as the part, and
broad enough to go round it; when it is made up into three Pleats, cut this
Cloth into three parts equal on every ſide, leaving about three inches plain
and undivided in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to ſupport the Leg, and ſtitch it along the
whole length of the undivided part. The ſeveral ranges of theſe Tails
muſt be all gradually longer and ſhorter than each other, <hi>viz.</hi> the
inmoſt ſhorteſt of all, the middle ſomething longer than that, and the
outmoſt longeſt of all; when the Bandage is laid under the Leg lay a
Compreſs under it to prevent the <hi>Pus</hi> from ſtaining it.</p>
                  <p>When things are thus prepared, apply the Tails on the
Fracture, raiſing them one on one ſide, and the other on the other, and
croſſing them, and ſo continue to raiſe the Heads of the firſt Range,
next lay two Compreſſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſame with the third Rank, and make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the Dreſſing
with Junks, Splints. Boulſters, Soals, Pillows, and Ribbons, as was directed
in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Dreſs the Fracture twice a Day, in the ſame
manner as contus'd Wounds which require Digeſtion. Take care to cover the
Bone if it lie bare with dry Pledgits, not ſuffering the Wound to cloſe
until the Bone be exfoliated, confine the Patient to a regular Diet, and then
Digeſt, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terge, and Cicatrize after the uſual manner.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. This kind of Fracture can ſcarce happen, without
ſome heavy thing falling on the part, or ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Blow.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. A Fracture of theſe Bones may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by
the great Confuſion, Deformity, Depreſſion, and craſhing Noiſe, which
may be heard upon ſtirring the Part.</p>
               <p>The Foot is compos'd of the <hi>Tarſus, Metatarſus</hi> and
Toes. The <hi>Tarſus</hi> is made up of ſeven Bones, three of which are
termed <hi>Cuneiformia,</hi> becauſe they are crowded like ſo many 
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42110:225"/>Wedges between the reſt; the four other are called
<hi>Aſtraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Calcaneum, Scapha,</hi> and <hi>Cuboides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſtragalus</hi> is a large irregular Bone, which is
cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſmooth Cartilage in the place, where it is united to the
<hi>Tibia</hi> by <hi>Ginglymos.</hi> It is ſeated between the two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and has a Cavity below which receives the Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the
<hi>Calcaneum,</hi> and in its fore-part it has a roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Protuberance
which enters into the Cavity of the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.</hi> The <hi>Calcaneum</hi> is
the largeſt of all the Bones of the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> the Body is
ſupported on it in Walking. and its Name is derived from its uſe. It is
larger behind than where it is joyned to the <hi>Cuboides.</hi> The
<hi>Scapha</hi> or <hi>Os Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare,</hi> derives its Name from its
reſembling a Boat, and is more even without than within; it has a Cavity
which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Protuberance of the <hi>Aſtragalus,</hi> and is joyned
before to the three <hi>Oſſa Cuneiformia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cuboides</hi> derives its Name from its Figure, though
its ſix ſides be not equal; it touches the <hi>Calcaneum</hi> the
<hi>Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare</hi> the <hi>Cuneiformia,</hi> and the laſt bones of the

               <p>The three Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> are unequal, and more
cloſely joyned without than within, and are connected to the
<hi>Naviculare,</hi> and three firſt Bones of the <hi>Metatarſus.</hi> All
the Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> are cloſely articulated, and bound
together by Ligaments and Cartilages, as in ſuch manner, that the
<hi>Tarſus</hi> ſeems to be only one piece.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Metatarſus</hi> which makes the ſole of the Foot, is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of a Range of five Bones, which are ſmooth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex outwardly,
and ſlender at that end where they are Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated with the firſt Range of
the Bones of the Fingers, on the inſide they are curve, and by this means
adapted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Tendons of the Muſcles. Theſe Bones have
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes both above and below their Articulation, with the Bones of the
<hi>Tarſus</hi> which is very cloſe, and the <hi>Muſculi
Inieroſſei</hi> lie between them.</p>
               <p>There are fourteen Bones in the Toes, the great Toe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two,
and each of the reſt three Bones. The firſt Range is longer than the
reſt, and their Structure and Articulation is the ſame with the Fingers,
except in this, that they are ſhorter than the latter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Metatarſus</hi> and Toes form a Cavity under the Soal
of the Foot, where the Tendons of the Muſcles paſs, and this Cavity hinders
them from being compreſſed in Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <p>Place the Patient on a Stool or on his Bed, and if the
<hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> or <hi>Metatarſus</hi> be fractured, let two
Aſſiſtants make the Extenſions, one having hold of the end of the Foot,
and the other of the Heel and the lower part of the Leg, and then reduce the
Bones.</p>
                  <p>The Toes are to be managed in the ſame manner as the Fingers
in the Hand.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Since there is a Wound ever in a Fracture of the
Foot, it muſt therefore be dreſt like all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Contuſed Wounds, that
is, digeſted not with greaſie Unguents which are apt to rot the Tendons,
but Spirituous Applications, as <hi>Oyl of Eggs, Oyl of Turpentine,</hi>
&amp;c. Firſt lay on Pledgits, and then a ſimple Compreſs around the Foot
dipt in ſome Defenſative Liquour; and laſtly, make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Bandage.</p>
                  <p>Take a Roller between two or three Ells long, and an Inch and
a half broad rolled up at both ends, begin with making a Circumvolution about
the bottom of the Leg, and then croſs on the bottom of the Foot; then bring
it under the Foot and croſs again, and return over the Foot croſſing, and
proceed to the end of the Foot in the ſame manner. (Theſe Turns of the
Roller leave Lozenge-like ſpaces, which has occaſion'd this Bandage to have
that Name given it) from the end of the Foot return to the Heel, bringing the
Roller up and covering the Foot with the Edgings, and then faſten by
ſeveral Circumvolutions about the Leg after the Bandage is made, lay the Leg
in the Junks, as directed in the Chapter of the Fracture of the Thigh.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXX.</hi> Of Luxations in General.</head>
               <p>THeſe kinds of Operations, <hi>are the Reducing of the Bones
diſlocated, into their Natural place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. Luxations moſt commonly are cauſed by ſome
Blow, Fall, or other External Accident; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe they
proceed from the too great Humidity and Relaxation of the Ligaments and Tendons
of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which are not firm enough to keep the Part in its place.
Sometimes that Mucilage which Nature furniſhes the Joynts with to lubricate
and make them ſupple, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed and coagulated by Acids, and becomes of
the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of Plaſter; and this filling up the Cavity, thruſts
the Head of the Bone out of its place.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Head of the Bones, and the contiguous Nervous
parts are united and cemented together by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain glutinous Matter, and this
is more dangerous than ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Luxations.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. If a Diſlocated Bone be compared with its
oppoſite which is in its proper place, (beſides the loſs of its Motion)
the Part will appear very different in its Length, Figure, and Poſition.</p>
               <p>Luxations are perfect when the Head of the Bone is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out
of the Cavity, or Partial when it is only ſo in part.</p>
               <p>The Diſlocation of the Thigh is the moſt difficult to
reduce, and that of the Heel-bone the moſt dangerous. The Thigh-bone has a
ſtrong Ligament which connects its Head to the <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> and
cannot be diſlocated except this be broke ſome violence, or very much
relaxed, and when this happens, it can never be re-united, and the Bone lies
ſo deep and is cover'd by ſo many Muſcles, that the Virtue of Medicines
cannot reach it, and the Patient muſt unavoidably continue lame all the
reſt of his Life. Children often eſcape more eaſily than Men, which
happens from the great Repoſe they take.</p>
               <p>The Danger in a Luxation of the Foot, proceeds from the numerous
Bones and Tendons in that part; but this is a caſe which very ſeldom
happens. There is a great Pain, and ſometimes a Convulſion happens in
reducing theſe parts which proceeds from the acute Senſe of the Tendons
which are diſtended and torn. Though the Hurt be ſmall the 
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42110:227"/>Part is inflamed, but if it be great there ſpring up
<hi>Fungus's,</hi> and the Patient is often convulſed.</p>
               <p>Authors pretend there are but theſe three Luxations which are
Mortal, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Spine, that of the lower Jaw when it is
perfect, and that of the Head with the firſt <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Luxation of the upper <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are very dangerous,
becauſe they compreſs the Spinal Marrow, and by this means intercept the
Animal Spirits.</p>
               <p>Imperfect Luxations are more eaſily reduced than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
ones, becauſe the Head of the Bone is on the edge of the Cavity, and do's not
require ſo much pains to bring it in.</p>
               <p>In Luxations which proceed from a Relaxation of the Ligaments,
it is eaſie enough to put the Bone into its place, but very difficult to
retain it there.</p>
               <p>The Articulation of the Arm with the <hi>Scapula</hi> and
Wriſt being very lax, thoſe Bones are eaſily diſlocated.</p>
               <p>Luxations in Women, Children, and lean Perſons, are reduced
with much greater eaſe than in luſty Men.</p>
               <p>When the Ligaments are broke, the Luxations are incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>When a Bone has but one Head, it is more eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it,
than if it had two.</p>
               <p>If Luxations be of long ſtanding, it is difficult to reduce
them, becauſe the Ligaments grow hard; the Cavity is filled up as well as the
Paſſage, by which the Bone ſhould be brought into its proper place.</p>
               <p>Luxations with Wounds are more dangerous and difficult to reduce
than ſimple ones, which is occaſioned by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which attend
them.</p>
               <p>In Luxations where the Edges of the Cavity are broke, the Bone
being reduced, ſoon falls out again.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>In imperfect Luxations, or ſuch as proceed from a Laxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of
the Ligaments; the part muſt be drawn as little as may be, becauſe in
imperfect Luxations, the Head of the Bone is not far out of its Natural place,
and when the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments are relaxed, they eaſily give way.</p>
                  <p>The Bone muſt be drawn till the Head be near the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
giving it ſeveral little turns on one ſide and another, as 
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42110:228"/>occaſion requires, and when the Head is on the Edge of
the Cavity, guide it in.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve here always to bring the Bone in the ſame way it
ſlipt out, and if the Part be inflamed, that muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abated
before the Reduction, leaſt the Patient be convuls'd.</p>
                  <p>The Extenſion muſt be greater or leſs as neceſſity
requires, or the Patient can endure it.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. After Reduction, keep the Part in its place with
a proper Bandage, uſing a Scarf if it be the Arm, Junks if the Leg or other
proper Machines in the reſt of the Body.</p>
                  <p>The Bandage muſt not be too ſtrait, for fear leaſt the
Blood-Veſſels and Lymphaticks be compreſt, and cauſe a Tumour, on the
other Hand it muſt not be too ſlack, for fear leaſt it be not
ſufficient to keep the part in its place, and a new Luxation happen.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If an Inflammation proceed from the ſtraitneſs
of a Bandage, it requires ſuch internal Medicines as promote the Fluidity and
Motion of the Blood, and ſuch External Medicines as diſperſe the
Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>If the Luxated Part be inflamed, you muſt not attempt to
reduce it till the Inflammation be abated, becauſe it is incapable of
neceſſary Extenſion, and the Pain may cauſe a Mortal Convulſion.</p>
                  <p>To prevent Inflammation, foment the part which is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with a Decoction of the tops of St. <hi>Johns wort, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,</hi> Tapſus
Barbatus, <hi>Roſemary,</hi> Stoechas Arabica, and dip the Rollers in that
Liquour; this Fomentation hinders the Stagnation of the Blood, prevents
Inflammation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores the Natural Springineſs of the Fibres.</p>
                  <p>There is very often Oedematous Tumours on the Part which is
Luxated; for the diſperſing of which, internal Sudoriſicks are uſeful
in conjunction with very penetrating Volatil Oyls. For this purpoſe,
Liniments made with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> and <hi>Humane
Bones</hi> are excellent.</p>
                  <p>The following Emplaſter is an excellent Diſcutient. Take
<hi>yellow Wax</hi> and very <hi>fine white Roſin,</hi> Melt theſe and put
a litle <hi>White Amber</hi> and <hi>Gum Elemi</hi> of each a ſufficient
quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to form a Maſs, incorporate theſe with <hi>Balſam of Peru,</hi>
and make an Emplaſter which is to be laid on the Fractured part; the two
edges of the Emplaſter muſt not touch each other, by reaſon of the
ſwelling of the Luxated Part. The contiguous Parts muſt by no means be
embrocated, except <pb n="423" facs="tcp:42110:228"/>it be with <hi>Oyl of Turpentine,</hi>
becauſe all Oleous Medicines ſtop the Pores hinder Perſpiration, and
relax the Parts inſtead of conſtringing them.</p>
                  <p>You muſt likewiſe forbear the uſe of Aſtringent
Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms which ſhut up the Pores, and cauſe a Tumour of the Part. It
is better for this purpoſe, to uſe Decoctions made of the Nervous Plants in
Wine.</p>
                  <p>If the Luxation proceed from a Hard, Plaſtry Matter, which
by degrees has thruſt the Bone out of its Cup, Diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and attenuating
Medicines are required to diſſolve the indurated Matter. The Internal ones
are ſuch as morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Acid, as the <hi>Volatil Spirit of Tartar,</hi> the
<hi>Volatil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Salt of Human Bones,</hi> with proper Laxatives and
Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriſicks premiſed. The External Diſcutients may be ſuch as
diſſolve the <hi>Coagulum;</hi> as <hi>Balſam of Peru</hi> mixed with
<hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine,</hi> or diſſolved with the <hi>Yolk of an Egg,</hi>
with a little <hi>Spirit of Ginger. Spirit of Earthworms</hi> is ſtill
better. <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> is very proper to reſolve the
<hi>Coagulum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Reduction of a Bone be too long deferred, a
<hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> is formed, which hinders it, and muſt be firſt
diſſolved by following Remedy. ℞. <hi>Diſtill'd Oyl of Humane
Bodies,</hi> p. 1. the <hi>Foetid Oyl of Tartar,</hi> p. 11. Mix theſe and
put <hi>Quick-lime</hi> over them, then diſtill with a Retort, and rub the
Part with this Oyl which is very penetrating.</p>
                  <p>If the Luxation proceed from a Relaxation of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
internal Sudorificks are good, and externally Diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, Aromaticks,
Aſtringents, mixed with <hi>Nervine Medicines,</hi> the Wounded part in a due
State. <hi>Crollius's</hi> Styptick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter mixed with <hi>Oyl of
Tartar,</hi> and <hi>Oyl of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> ſpread on Glove Leather
and applied on the Part, is very proper.</p>
                  <p>If the Bone be Diſlocated and Fractured, theſe
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs muſt be both remedied at once, and proper Extenſions and
Bandages made for each, as they ſhall happen to require.</p>

                     <hi>Fabr. Hildanus, Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 90. tells
us, That a certain young Maid having wrenched her Foot without any
Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, did for ſome Days walk on it without any very great trouble.
But neglecting it the Pain increaſed ſome ſmall time after, and the Part
became tumefied and inflamed; upon this a Mountebank was ſent for, who having
violently hall'd and twiſted about the Part, applied an Aſtringent
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm <pb n="424" facs="tcp:42110:229"/>made of <hi>Bole Armoniack,</hi> the
<hi>Four Meals,</hi> the white of an <hi>Egg,</hi> and made a very ſtrait
Bandage, without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her Body before the Operation; this occaſioned the
Pain to encreaſe, and there was a Fluxion on the Part, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a
continual Feaver, <hi>Delirium</hi> and Reſtleſſneſs. After ſome time
an Abſceſs which was formed in the Part broke, and ſeveral carious Bones
were thrown out, and the Patient continued lame all her Life after.</p>
                  <p>This Inſtance plainly demonſtrates, of how dangerous
conſequence it is to neglect Wrenches and Luxations, or to torment the
Patient while the Part continues pain'd and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</p>

they happen to be ſeparated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. This Diſtemper ariſes from an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Moiſture which renders the Bones lax and yielding, (eſpecially if the
Sutures are not cloſe) or too great a quantity of Blood paſſing through
the Veſſels of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which inceſſantly beats on the
Bones of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and at length forces them quite aſunder.
The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mounſieur <hi>Paſcal,</hi> had the bones of the

continual and intenſe thinking.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>This is bringing the Bones together, by compreſſing them
with the Palm of the Hand, and then keeping them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome convenient
Bandage.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Cut off the Patients Hair, and lay a Compreſs

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42110:229"/>and Spirituous Liquour, and make the Bandage called the

                  <p>To make this, take a Roller about an inch and a half broad,
and four or five Ells in length rolled up at both ends, and begin to apply it
on the middle of the Fore-head, then bring the two Heads of the Roller behind
the Head and croſs them, and engage one end of the Roller by paſſing the
other over it; then raiſe one end of the Roller and bring it over the
Sagittal Suture quite to the middle of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and there engage it with
the other Head of the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which you muſt bring over the Fore-head; then
raiſe the Roller and bring it over the Head making an Edging on the firſt

               <p>THE SIGNS. When theſe Bones are Luxated, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a
ſmall Cavity between the Bones of the Forehead and Noſe, and theſe laſt
ſhake upon the leaſt touch; the Noſe it ſelf is diſtorted, and the
Patient breaths with difficulty.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>This Diſlocation ſeldom happens, the Bones of the Noſe
and the Coronal Bone being very firmly united, and when it does, it muſt be
reduced in the following manner. Take a ſmall ſtick of Deal of a proper
ſize planed and fitted to the Noſtrils, and wrapt round with Tow; and then
placing the Thumb on the Root of the Noſe, partly on the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and partly
on the Naſal Bone to keep the Bones ſteddy, put them into their place with
the ſtick. In putting the ſtick up, you muſt take care not to hurt the
ſpungy Bones of the Noſe, for fear of Wounding the Part, and cauſing
ill-conditioned Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING is the ſame as in Fractures of the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If there be a Wound, dreſs it once every day as a
Complicate Wound.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXXIII.</hi> Of the Luxation of the lower
Jaw.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>Reſtoring the Head of the Bone into its
Natural Cavity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Luxation of the lower Jaw often proceeds, from
opening the Mouth too wide in yawning. This Luxation moſt commonly happens in
the Fore-part, and rarely in the hinder, by reaſon of the Mamillary
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which hinder the Bone from ſlipping behind. The Jaw is
ſometimes luxated on one ſide only, and at other times on both.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. When the Jaw-bone is diſlocated only on one ſide,
it is turned tranſverſly, and is plainer and more depreſt, than the
ſound ſide on which there is an apparent Tumour. The Patients Mouth
ſtands wide open, and he can neither ſhut it nor chew his Meat; and the
Teeth of the lower Jaw ſtand out farther than thoſe of the upper, and do
not anſwer to the correſpondent ones on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>When the Mandible is luxated on both ſides, it hangs on the
Breaſt, and the <hi>Saliva</hi> flows inceſſantly from the Mouth, the
Parotid Glands being compreſt by the Head of the Bone. There is a Tenſion
of the Temporal Muſcles, and the Patient can neither ſhut his Mouth, nor
ſtir his Tongue.</p>
               <p>When there is a Diſlocation on both ſides, the Bone is much
more difficult to reduce, than when it is on one ſide only, and the Accidents
are more deſperate; and unleſs it be inſtantly reſtored, there is a
great Pain, Feaver, and an Inflammation of the Throat, and the Patient dies in
ten days time.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the Bone has been out for any time, Emollient Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
muſt be uſed before it can be reſtored.</p>
                  <p>To reduce a compleat Luxation when both Heads of the Bone are
out; let the Patient ſit upon the Floor or a low Stool, and place a Servant
behind to ſupport and keep his Head ſteddy, and then put both your Thumbs
into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients <pb n="428" facs="tcp:42110:231"/>Mouth, having wrapt them round with a
Tape to defend them from being hurt by the Patients Teeth, and to hinder them
from ſlipping when you preſs on the lower Jaw; then clap your other Fingers
under the Patients Chin, to draw the Jaw and raiſe it up.</p>
                  <p>But if the Mouth be ſo cloſe that you cannot thruſt your
Thumbs in, put a ſmall Wooden Wedge about an inch thick, and introducing
theſe Wedges ſtrongly by their thinner end, keep them on the Teeth; in the
laſt place, put a Girth under the Chin, and let a Servant put both his Knees
on the Patients Shoulders, and draw the ends of the Girth, while you thruſt
down the Wedges to bring the Jaw into its place.</p>
                  <p>When it is only Diſlocated on one ſide, place the Patient
on a low Stool, and let a Servant ſtand behind to keep his Head ſteddy;
then put your Thumb on the Grinders of that ſide which is diſlocated, and
thruſt the Jaw down, and reduce it into its place.</p>
                  <p>The Mandible may be reduced ſometimes by a blow of the
Fiſt only, on that ſide which is not luxated, but this can only take place
when the Luxation is uncompleat.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING is the ſame as in a Fracture of the Jaw.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient feed on Nouriſhing Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids, for
he cannot eat any thing that is ſolid, and let him keep himſelf ſtill in
his Bed; and if there be the leaſt ſigns of Inflammation, give him
Clyſters to keep his Body o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>

               <p>THE CAUSE of the Luxation, is ſome Blow or Fall.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Reſtoring one of the</hi> Vertebrae
<hi>which is ſlipt out of its place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. The Diſlocation of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from ſome Blow, Fall, Strain, Violent Motion of the Body, or ſome ill
Poſture, or the Relaxation of ſome Ligament by a Flux of Humours.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. Diſlocations of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are compleat
or imperfect.</p>
               <p>In an imperfect Luxation of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> the Neck
remains diſtorted, the Face is Livid, and the Patient has a great Difficulty
to ſpeak and breath; but if the Luxation be compleat, the Nerves and Spinal
Marrow ſuffer a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Compreſſion, and the Patient muſt inevitably
die, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be relieved forthwith.</p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:42110:232"/>
               <p>The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back may be diſlocated four
ſeveral ways, Outwardly, Inwardly, to the Right, and to the Left. When any of
the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are luxated inwardly, there is a Depreſſion in the
place, but if outwardly, onthe contrary there is a Tumour. If the
<hi>Vertebrae</hi> be ſlipt outſide-ways, there is an unuſual riſing
that way.</p>
               <p>When any of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> are luxated inwardly, the
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has a Difficulty of making Water and voiding his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, cannot
move his Thigh without a great deal of difficulty, and it becomes cold;
becauſe the Origin of the Nerves which are diſpenſed to that Part are
compreſſed, and theſe ſort of Luxations where the <hi>Vertebra</hi> is
ſlipt inwards, are very difficult to reduce, becauſe there can be no
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made on the Belly for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back bunch out in Children, the
Ribs do not grow at all, or at leaſt but very little, and jet forwards, and
make an acute Angle at the <hi>Sternum,</hi> by which means the Cavity of the
Breaſt is not capacious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Expanſion of the Lungs, but they
being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, the Patient becomes Aſthmatick.</p>
               <p>If the Spine be convex, there is a ſtop put to its growth, but
the Arms and Legs encreaſe exceedingly.</p>
               <p>When the Rump-bone is diſlocated, the Patient cannot bring his
Heel towards his Buttock, nor bend his Knee without a great deal of Difficulty,
nor can he ſit or go to Stool without a great deal of trouble.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To reduce the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, of whatever kind
the Luxation be, place the Patient on a low Chair, and let a Servant lay a
great ſtreſs on his Shoulders, and while he does this, take hold of the
Patients Head under the Ears, and making an Extenſion of it, turn it to and
fro till it be reduced; and you may know that it is ſo, by his being able to
turn it himſelf, and the ceſſation of the Pain.</p>
                  <p>To reduce the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> which are luxated externally,
let the Patient be laid on a Table on his Belly, and faſten a Girth under his
Arm-pits, and on the Hips, and tie at the ſame time his Thighs and Legs, and
draw both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, without making ſo violent an Extenſion, and in
the mean time reduce the Part.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Vertebra</hi> cannot be reduced in this manner,
take two ſticks near a Fingers breadth in thickneſs, and about four or five
times as long, and wrap theſe in a Cloth for fear <pb n="431" facs="tcp:42110:232"/>of
hurting the Patient; then lay one of theſe ſticks on each ſide the
diſlocated part, and make a great preſſure on them, to thruſt in the
<hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or take a great Roller of Wood, ſuch as Paſtry-cooks
uſe, and roll it to and fro on the two ſticks; Note here that the two
ſticks which are on the ſide, be higher than the Spinal Proceſs of the
<hi>Vertebrae,</hi> to prevent all danger of breaking it.</p>
                  <p>You may conclude the <hi>Vertebra</hi> is reduced, if it be
equal with the contiguous ones.</p>
                  <p>Though the Luxation of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> inwardly be
almoſt impoſſible to reduce, and moſt commonly is Mortal, you muſt
not nevertheleſs abandon the Patient; and therefore when this happens, place
the Patient on his Back, and make an Extenſion with Pullies, in the manner
above deſcribed, and then manage the Spine, and try to bring in the
<hi>Vertebra.</hi> If this fail, make an Inciſion on the <hi>Vertebra,</hi>
which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt juſt over its Spinal Proceſs, and take hold of it, and
endeavour to reduce it in this manner.</p>
                  <p>If the Rump-bone be thruſt in by any Blow or Fall, put the
Fore-finger of the right Hand into the <hi>Anus</hi> and puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up with
the left Hand preſs it out, and guide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its place.</p>
                  <p>If the Luxation be external, which ſometimes happens in
violent Labours, put the Bone gently in with the Fingers. Theſe Bones are
confirm'd in three Weeks.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck are
reduced, let the Patient incline his Head to that ſide which is oppoſite to
the Diſlocation, and put a Fillet about the Neck, which muſt be faſtned
on the Arm.</p>
                  <p>If you have made an Inciſion on the <hi>Vertebra,</hi> and
there enſue a Flux of Blood, ſtop it with Aſtringents.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Vertebra</hi> be luxated outwardly, lay a ſmall
Plate of Lead on each ſide to keep it in its place, and lay a thick
Compreſs over it, and keep this on with the Napkin and Scapulary, as is
directed in the Chapter of the <hi>Empyema.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Luxation be inwards, the <hi>Vertebra</hi> muſt not
be compreſt by Bandages, nor any Plates or Splints laid on it for fear of
occaſioning a new Diſlocation.</p>
                  <p>In a Luxation of the Rump-bone, whether inwards or outwards,
the Dreſſing muſt be the ſame as in a Fracture of the Rump-bone.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. If any Inciſion be made to bring out the
<hi>Vertebra</hi> which is luxated inwards, the Wound muſt be dreſt after
the uſual manner, and the Patient muſt lie on one ſide, and obſerve a
good Diet.</p>

               <p>THE CAUSE of their Luxation, moſt commonly is ſome Blow or
Fall.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The Luxated Ribs are either depreſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or
elevated outwards. When a Rib is depreſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, there is an apparent
Cavity near its Articulation with the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, but if
the Head of the Rib ſlip outwards, there is a hard Tumour on the Part, and in
both <pb n="433" facs="tcp:42110:233"/>one and the other kind of Luxation, Reſpiration is
painful and laborious, and the Patient cannot move his Body without Pain,
becauſe the Rib preſſes on the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The Mucronated Cartilage is inverted, and its point turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Orifice of the Stomach are hurt, and the Veſſels being ſtrongly
compreſt, by this means the Circulation of the Blood is interrupted. When
this Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage is luxated, there is a great hollow in the lower part of the
Breaſt, and the Patient cannot breath without a great deal of Pain and
Difficulty.</p>

                  <p>When a Rib is luxated outwards, lay the Patients Arm over a
Door to ſuſpend the Body, and then thruſt the riſing of the Rib into

                  <p>If the Rib be luxated inwards, you muſt make an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

he did not feel any ſuch pain. After ſome time the Tumour abating, it was

with an oleous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour, which make it eaſily ſlip aſide upon the
application of any force outwardly.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. When the Luxation is downwards, and the Head of the
Shoulder-blade is ſlipt into the Arm-pit, there is a Cavity on the Shoulder,
the <hi>Acromion</hi> is ſharp and jets out; the Elbow ſtands out, and
cannot be brought to the Body without force; it is drawn forwards more

cannot lay his Hand on the oppoſite Shoulder, or bring it to his Mouth, and
he feels a great deal of pain when he ſtirs it in any manner whatever, by
reaſon of the Compreſſion and Tenſion of the Muſcles; but obſerve
here, that the Diſability to lift or extend the Arm, is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>The Luxation of the Shoulder may be reduced in ſix
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral manners, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Fiſt, by the Shoulder placed under
the Patients Arm-pit, by a ball of thread thruſt by the Heel by a Ball on a
Leaver, by the Ladder; and laſtly, by the <hi>Amby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To reduce a Shoulder by the help of the Fiſt clenched, lay
the Patient on a Table on that ſide which is oppoſite to the Light, and let
one Servant put a Girth under his Arm-pit, and another a ſecond above the
Elbow; let him who holds the Girth which paſſes under the Arm-pit keep it
firm, and let him who has hold of that above the Elbow, draw it till the Head
of the Bone be directly againſt the Socket, and then put it into its Cavity
with your Hands or Fiſt; if the Hands are not ſufficient, you may make
uſe of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
                  <p>Or if you pleaſe, you may place the Patient on a low Seat
(or if he be a big Man, he may ſit on the ground) and plant a Servant on one
ſide to hold the Patients Body with his Arms, or a Towel, and then take hold
of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the <hi>Humerus</hi> with both Hands, and let another
Servant kneel behind you, and take hold of the Luxated Arm above the Elbow
which paſſes between your Legs, and while both theſe make the
Extenſion, do you knap the bone into its Cavity.</p>
                  <p>To reduce a Shoulder with the Heel, lay the Patient on the
Ground on a Coverlet or Quilt, and then put a Ball of thread under his Armpit,
and do you ſit oppoſite to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient directly againſt the luxated Arm,
and if it be the Foot, place the Heel of the right, and if it be the left, the
Heel of the left Foot on the Ball; then take the Patients Arm with both Hands,
and draw it towards the Feet, and thruſt the Ball ſtrongly againſt the
Arm-pit. In the mean time let a Servant ſtand behind the Patients Head, and
draw the Head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> with a Napkin, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Girth, and
put the Soal of his Foot on the Patients Shoulder, and thruſt it down; and
let another Servant be plac'd behind to keep his Body ſteddy.</p>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:42110:235"/>
                  <p>To reduce a Shoulder by the help of the Shoulder of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Perſon, place the Patients Arm-pit on the Acute end of the Shoulder of a
luſty Man, who is taller than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that ſo he may keep him
ſuſpended; the Man who holds him keeping his Hand to his Breaſt; and
while this is doing, put the Head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> into its Cavity. If
the Patient be very light, and the Weight of his Body be not ſufficient to
reduce the Shoulder, let ſome Perſon or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hang on his Shoulder. If the
Patient be ſo tall that it is difficult to find a Man of a higher Stature,
let the Man ſtand on ſome ſmall Stool.</p>
                  <p>To reduce the Arm with the Leaver, take one four or five Foot
long with a bunch like a Tennis Ball in the midſt, and on each ſide the
Ball put in two pegs at ſuch a diſtance, that the Shoulder may lodge
between them; then placing the Patients Arm-pit on the Ball; let two Men lift
up the ends of the ſtaff and raiſe the Patient from the Ground, and in the
mean time do you draw down the Arm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Head of the Bone into its
Natural place.</p>
                  <p>To reduce a Luxation of the Shoulder with the Ladder, faſten
a Ball of thread on the ſtep of a Ladder, which muſt be of a convenient
ſize to put under the Arm-pit; then let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent get upon a Stool, and
tie both his Legs together, and the Arm which is ſound behind his Back, that
it may not reſt on his Shoulder when in the Reduction, then place the Arm-pit
on the Ball, and bring the Ladder as near him as may be, for fear leaſt the
Arm be broke in the Reduction; in the next place, put a ſtrong Girth above
the Elbow, and let a ſtout Fellow hold this ſtrongly, and then take away
the Stool, and this will bring the Head of the Luxated Bone into its place, or
if it do's not, you muſt twiſt it on one ſide and another, till it knaps
into its place. When it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, you muſt put the Stool again under the
Patients Feet, and take the Arm carefully out of the Ladder, having great care
not to lift it up for fear of a new Diſlocation.</p>
                  <p>In ſtead of a Ladder, you may if you pleaſe make uſe of
a Door, obſerving the ſame Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Amby</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> known to our
Surgeons by the Name of the Commander, is made of two pieces of Wood faſtned
with pins; theſe pieces of Wood muſt be near two Inches and a half
diſtant from each other, and to the top of theſe another piece muſt be
faſtned, which is longer than a Mans Arm, and which advances half a Foot at
one end. This laſt moveable piece of Wood muſt be faſtned between 
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42110:235"/>the other two with a Pin on which it turns, and may be
raiſed or let down at the end.</p>
                  <p>To reduce the diſlocated Arm with this Inſtrument, place
the Patient on a low Stool, ſomething lower than the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,</hi> with
his Feet tied together for fear he riſe when the part ought to be reduced,
the Patients Arm muſt be laid all along this moveable branch, the leſſer
end of it being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Patients Arm-pit, and tied in two or three
places, and when this is done depreſs the lower end, and this will bring the
Head of the Bone into its place.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. When the <hi>Humerus</hi> is reduced, put a
ſmall ball of Lint under the Arm-pit to fill the Cavity, and keep this ball
on with a Compreſs cleft at both ends, which you muſt bring up and croſs
on the Shoulder; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, you muſt lay a Compreſs on the other
Arm-pit for fear leaſt the Compreſs hurt it, and make the Bandage called
<hi>Spica</hi> with a Roller five Ells in length, and three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches broad
rolled up at one end.</p>
                  <p>In applying this bring the end of the Roller under the Arm-pit
oppoſite to the Luxation, then bring the other end of the Roller over the
part affected, and back again under the ſame Arm-pit; and laſtly over, ſo
as to croſs over the firſt turn on the Shoulder, then bring the Roller over
the Breaſt, and next under the Arm-pit, oppoſite to that which is affected;
then paſs behind the Back and under that Arm which was luxated, and make a
ſmall Edging there, then bring it under the Arm-pit and over the Shoulder and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue theſe turns of the Roller in this manner, making Edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings every
time you paſs over the Shoulder concerned. Theſe Edgings ſomething
reſemble an Ear of Wheat, and this it is which gives the Bandage this Name.
When the Shoulder is covered, which is done by gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the
Arm, make two Circular turns round the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> and
theſe will make a Triangle which is called <hi>Geranium,</hi> or the Cranes
Bill; this Triangle muſt be covered by riſing with Edgings, and when this
is done, bring the Roller round the Breaſt and faſten it, and put the Arm
in a Sling. The manner of which we have deſcribed in the Chapter of the
Fracture of the Arm.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient keep his Arm in a Sling, the Cubit
making a right Angle with the Arm, and reſting on the Ribs.</p>
                  <p>The Dreſſings muſt not be taken off the firſt four or

                     <hi>Fabr. Hildanus</hi> tells us, that a Child of eight years
of Age, of a good Habit of Body, had his right Arm diſlocated by a Fall,
which mightily emaciated and waſted him, and this was the more remarkable,
that leſſening, while the other parts grew larger. At length his Relations

               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>a Reſtoring the Cubit to its
Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the</hi> Humerus.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. This Diſlocation proceeds from ſome Fall or
Relaxation of the Ligaments.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The Cubit is luxated in four ſeveral manners,
either inwards or outwards, or on one ſide.</p>
               <p>When the Cubit is luxated inwards, the <hi>Olecranon</hi> is
ſtopt in the internal Cavity of the Condyl of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone, the Arm is
bent, and the Hand is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but if the Luxation be outwards, the Arm
is ſtrait and ſhorter than the other; the internal Proceſs of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
lies in the external Cavity of the Condyl of the <hi>Hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and the
<hi>Olecranon</hi> paſſes beyond the Cavity, which naturally it ought to
lodg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in. If the Luxation be
on one ſide, there is a riſing in the place of the Head of the Bone, and a
Depreſſion where it is ſupt out. Theſe Luxations for the moſt part
are incompleat.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the Luxation be inwards, let ſeveral Servants make an
Extenſion of the <hi>Humerus</hi> and Arm, and in the mean time bend the Arm,
and bring the Hand to the Shoulder.</p>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:42110:236"/>
                  <p>There are divers Practitioners who lay a Ball on the Flexure
of the Joynt, and then bend the Arm preſently, bringing it to the
Shoulder.</p>
                  <p>If the Cubit be luxated outwards, let the Arm be drawn above
and below, and during theſe Extenſions, put the <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranon</hi> into
its Cavity. In reducing this Luxation, you muſt not bend the Arm as in the
former caſe, becauſe a Motion of this kind would hinder its Reduction.</p>
                  <p>If you like it better you may proceed thus; take the Patients
Arm and put it round a Pillar, and faſten a Girth near the Proceſs of the
<hi>Cubitus,</hi> and then draw this with a Leaver round the Pillar, till the
Bone knap into its place. Or take a ſtick of a Foot long and an inch
Diameter, and wrap the middle of this round with a Cloth, then take hold of
both ends with each Hand, and puſh ſtrongly in the Head of the Bone with
the middle of the ſtick, while the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants make the Extenſion. This
laſt Method of Reducing the Bone is very ſerviceable, when the Luxation is
inwards or outwards, but if the Cubit be ſlipt on one ſide, let two
Servants take hold one of the Arm, and the other of the Shoulder; and then
reduce the Bone into its place. Note here, that a Luxation of the Cubit can
hardly be without the <hi>Radius,</hi> ſtarting from the Shoulder-bone, and
therefore in reducing the Cubit, the Surgeon muſt examine whether the
<hi>Radius</hi> remain in its place, which he may diſcover by the Pronation
and Supination of the Hand; for if he be unable to do this, it is a certain
Sign that the <hi>Radius</hi> is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING. Lay a ſimple Compreſs dipt in ſome
Defenſative Liquour, to take off the Inflammation. This Compreſs muſt be
ſlit lengthways, for the better applying it on the Juncture, and when it is
on, make a Bandage with a Roller five Ells long, and an Inch and a half broad.
In doing this, firſt make a Circular turn on the lower part of the
<hi>Humerus,</hi> then deſcend obliquely in the bending of the Arm, and make
a Circular turn on the upper part of the Arm, and an X on the Flexure of the
Elbow, and thus continue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend and deſcend, making Edgings on the
Elbow, and Xs on the bending of the Joynt, till the Elbow be quite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and when this is done, aſcend up the Arm and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the Roller about the
Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Put the Arm in a Sling, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was
deſcribed in the Fracture of this part. Let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient uſe a good
Nouriſhing Diet, and often make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <pb n="440" facs="tcp:42110:237"/>and
Supination of his Arm, for fear leaſt the Bones be cemented together.</p>

               <p>THE CAUSE. This Luxation moſt commonly proceeds from ſome

               <p>THE SIGNS. The Diſlocation of the Wriſt is either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
outwards, or one ſide. When the Diſlocation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the Hand is
turned back when it is outwards, it is bent, when it is on the right ſide the
ſide of the little Finger; and when on the left, it is turned on the ſide
of the Thumb.</p>
               <p>The Articulation of the Hand being very lax, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be

                  <p>If the Luxation be inwards, lay the back of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Hand
on a Table, and while the Extenſion is making, preſs the prominent bone
into its place with the Palm of your Hand. If the Luxation be outwardly, lay
the flat of the Patients Hand, and proceed as before. If the Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be on
one ſide when the Extenſion is made, twiſt the Bones on the ſide
oppoſite to the Diſlocation, and draw each Finger ſeparately, that ſo
the Tendons may come into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Metacarpus</hi> is compoſed of four Bones. The two
middle of theſe cannot be diſlocated on one ſide, becauſe they are
ſupported by the two Bones which are on each ſide. That which ſuſtains

towards the Fore-finger, nor <pb n="441" facs="tcp:42110:237"/>that which ſuſtains the

inwards or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but ſince the manner of Reducing them is the ſame as
with that of the <hi>Carpus,</hi> I ſhall remit the Reader thither.</p>
                  <p>The Fingers may be diſlocated inwards, outwards, or one

                  <hi>CHAP. LXXXI.</hi> Of the Luxation of the Thigh.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>the Reduction of the Head of the Thigh
bone, into the Cavity of the</hi> Iſchion.</p>
               <p>THE CAUSE. A perfect Luxation of the Thigh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happen,
except the Part ſuffer great Violence, for the Head of the Thigh-bone is
retained in the Cavity of the <hi>Acetabulum</hi> by a ſtrong Ligament. The
Circumference of this Cavity is edged with Cartilaginous Ligaments, which
likewiſe cover the Neck of the Head of the Thigh-bone, <pb n="442" facs="tcp:42110:238"/>and ſeveral of the largeſt and ſtrongeſt Muſcles of the
whole Body are inſerted into this Bone, and conſpire to ſtrengthen this
Articulation. Sometimes indeed a Luxation happens from too great a Relaxation
of the Ligaments, but this is ever an imperfect one.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. When the Head of the Bone is ſtopt on the
ſhare-bones, there is a Tumour in the place where the Head of the Bone is,
one Leg is longer than the other, and the Knee and Foot are turned outwards;
the Knee cannot be bent, and the Thigh brought toward the Groin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the
Head of the Bone keeps the Muſcles exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>If the Head of the Bone be ſlipt outwards, the Leg is
ſhorter, becauſe the Head of the Bone paſſes over its Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Knee
and Foot is turned inwards, and the Heel outwards, and the Patient cannot
ſupport himſelf, except on the end of his Foot. It ſometimes happens that
the Head of the Thigh-bone remaining for a conſiderable time in the ſame
place, forms a ſort of a Cavity amongſt the Muſcles, which are hardned by
a conſtant compreſſion of the Bone, and by this means ſometimes the
Patient is able to walk without a ſtick.</p>
               <p>When the Thigh-bone is ſlipt forwards, the Head of the Bone is
lodged on the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> and makes a Tumour in the Groin, and the
Muſcles of the Buttocks have Furrows in them, which is cauſed by their very
great Tenſion. The Patient cannot bring his Thigh to the Groin, nor bend his
Knee, both Legs in a manner equal, and the Luxated Leg can reſt on the Heel
only; and there is frequently a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Urine, which proceeds
from the Compreſſion of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>When the Luxation is backwards, there is a large Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on the
Buttock, which is made by the Head of the Bone, and the Pain is very great
which is occaſioned by the violent Tenſion of the Muſcles, the Leg is
ſhorter than the other, and there is a depreſſion in the Groin, the
Patient cannot bend his Leg but it hangs back.</p>
               <p>If the Luxation proceed from an internal Cauſe, there is
ſmall hopes of the Patients Recovery.</p>

                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To reduce a Luxation inwards, lay the Patient with his Back on
a Table, and put into the Table a Pin a Foot or <pb n="443" facs="tcp:42110:238"/>two long,
and put this between the Patients Legs near the Groin; then faſten one Girth
under the Juncture of the Thigh, and another above the Patients Knee, and with
theſe let the Extenſion be made. In the mean time put the Head of the Bone
into the <hi>Acetabulum;</hi> when the Head of the Bone is drawn enough, let
the Aſſiſtants who make the Extenſion ſlacken a little, for the more
eaſie reducing the Head of the Bone; and this is to be obſerved in all
Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions whatever.</p>
                  <p>If the Thigh be luxated outwards, let the Patient lie on his
Belly, and make an Extenſion with Girths after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſcribed, and
thruſt the Thigh inwards to bring the Head of the Bone into the Cavity.</p>
                  <p>If the Luxation be forwards, lay the Patient on the
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide, and make the Extenſions as before; and when this is done,
put the Head of the Bone into its cavity with a Tennis Ball, and puſh this
with the Hand or with the Knee, for the greater force, and bring the luxated
Leg to the other.</p>
                  <p>If the Luxation be backwards, place the Patient on his Belly,
as in a Luxation outwards, and let the Extenſion be made in the ſame
manner; then take the Patients Knee and draw it outwards, to bring the Head of
the Bone into the <hi>Acetabulum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Ligaments of the Thigh are relaxed, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
muſt not be ſtrong; for it is plain, this is both uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and hurtful,
and a prudent Surgeon muſt always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Nature of the Luxation,

                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient refrain from all Cold, Moiſt, and
Phlegmatick Meats, and uſe a ſtrengthning Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and drink Ptiſans
aromatized with <hi>Roſemary, Sage, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram,</hi> chafe the Neighbouring
parts with Oyls of <hi>Dill, Chamomil,</hi> and <hi>White Lilies;</hi> and
becauſe the Patient leads a Sedentary Life, and there is apt to be a
congeſtion of Humours in the part, purge his Body at convenient times with
Lenitives, and if you ſhould now and then give him a Vomit, it would not be a
miſs.</p>
                  <p>As for local Applications, take a bag of leaves and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>Betony, Sage, Roſemary, Primula veris, Lavender,</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganum,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Kerkringius, Obſ.</hi> 61. tells us, that in opening one
of his Neeces who had in her Life-time been afflicted with a lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which
had eluded all attempts to cure her (for want of a right underſtanding of the
Cauſe) he found the Cavity of the Hip very large and deep, and the Head of
the Thigh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſmall, by which means it eaſily ſlipt up and down,
the Ligaments being relaxed, and elongated by the Weight of the Thigh, upon
drawing the Leg it would be equal to the other, becauſe the Head of the
Thigh-bone was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed in its Cavity, but then again it would immediately
fall out.</p>
               </div>
            </div>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. LXXXII.</hi> Of the Luxation of the Knee.</head>
               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>a Reſtoring the</hi> Tibia <hi>to its
Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Thigh-bone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of this Diſlocation is ſome Fall, Strain, Wrench,
or Relaxation of the Ligament.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. The <hi>Tibia</hi> may be luxated four ways,
<hi>viz.</hi> downwards, forwards, or on either ſide.</p>
               <p>It ſeldom happens that the Leg is luxated forwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Tendons of the Muſcles of the Leg keep the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> ſtreight;
and when ſuch a Diſlocation happens, thoſe Tendons muſt be lacerated or
exceedingly relaxed. When the <hi>Tibia</hi> is luxated backward, the Condyls
are in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of the
Ham, and the Leg is bent. When the <hi>Tibia</hi> is luxated on one ſide,
there is a riſing on that ſide, and a Depreſſion on the oppoſite; if
the Condyl be ſlipt inwards, <pb n="445" facs="tcp:42110:239"/>there is a Riſing
within, and a Depreſſion outwards, and the Leg is turned outwards, and
directly the contrary happens, when it is luxated inwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tibia</hi> is eaſily luxated, becauſe its
Articulation is not very ſtrict, the Condyls of the <hi>Tibia</hi> jet out,
and the <hi>Sinus</hi> are ſhallow.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>To reduce the Luxation when the Head of the Bone is ſlipt
backward, place the Patient on a low Stool, or a Bench of a midling height,
with his back turned towards you, then put his Leg between yours, and bend it
with both Hands towards the Patients Buttocks.</p>
                  <p>Or let the Patient lie on his Belly, and take a Coul-ſtaff
with a Bunch or Ball in the midſt, let an Aſſiſtant put this on the
bending of the Ham, and on the end of the Bone which jets out, and let another
put a Girth ſomething more than two Inches broad, and in the mean time bend
it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly againſt the Buttock.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſlocation be forwards, let the Patient lie on his
Back, and put one Girth above the Knee, and another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Juncture of the
Foot, and put the Knee into its place with your Hands, or a Coul-ſtaff with a
bunch in the midſt. If your Hands are not ſtrong enough, you may make uſe
of Pullies; when the Leg is well reduced, the Patient can bend or extend, or
make uſe of it in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without Pain.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Tibia</hi> be luxated on one ſide when the
Extenſion is made, bring the Head of the Bone into its place, with your Hands
or a Coul-ſtaff with a bunch in the midſt, the Patient lying on a Table
during the Operation.</p>
                  <p>If the leſſer Focil be luxated in its upper part, you may
thruſt it into its place with your Hand.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING in theſe Diſlocations, is the ſame as in a
Fracture of the <hi>Rotula.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE CURE. Let the Patient keep his Bed with his Leg extended,
and laid in Junks. After ſome tune, let him ſtir it a little to prevent the
Coalition of the Bones, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Cure, let them uſe a good
Nouriſhing Diet.</p>

               <p>THIS Operation is <hi>a Reducing the luxated Bones into their
Natural place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE CAUSE of this Diſlocation, moſt commonly is ſome
Wrench.</p>
               <p>THE SIGNS. If the Juncture of the <hi>Aſtragalus</hi> with the
<hi>Tibia</hi> be ſeparated, is a Riſing occaſioned by the Bone. If the
<hi>Aſtragalus</hi> be ſlipt inwards, the Soal of the Foot is turned out;
and if it be diſlocated outwards, the Soal is turned in. If it be ſlipt, in
the great Tendon implanted into the Heel, is almoſt quite hid in the
Foot.</p>
               <p>The Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> and Foot are diſlocated
diverſe ways, all which appear by the prominences and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <div type="operation">
                  <head>The OPERATION.</head>
                  <p>If the <hi>Tibia</hi> and the leſſer Focil are
ſeparated, put them into their place with your Hand, in the beſt manner
that you can.</p>
                  <p>You may reduce the <hi>Aſtragalus</hi> by drawing, and
forcibly thruſting the Foot to that part oppoſite to that from whence it
ſlipt.</p>
                  <p>If the Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> are ſlipt upwards, let
the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſet his Foot on a Table or the Floor, and then thruſt the
Bones into their place, if the prominence be below or on one ſide; you muſt
in the ſame manner thruſt the Bone into its place.</p>
                  <p>If the Bones of the Toes are diſlocated, they muſt be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ſame manner as all the other Bones after a due Extenſion
made. Upon the whole Matter in theſe and the like Matters, good Senſe with
ſome Experience goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than all the Inſtructions which can be
delivered in Books.</p>
                  <p>THE DRESSING and CURE are the ſame as in ſimple Fractures
of the Foot.</p>

                  <p>In the fourth Month the Bones of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> are
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely formed, and the oſſification of the Bones of the
<hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> begins to appear by ſeveral ſmall bloody Spots. In the
ſame Month the upper and lower Junctures of the Toes of the Foot are
diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral white ſpots, and thoſe in the middle are
Cartilaginous.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth and ſixth Month, the ſecond Rank which is

                  <p>From the fourth to the ninth Month, the Bones of the Foot
